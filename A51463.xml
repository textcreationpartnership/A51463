            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Am very ſenſible in what manner I expoſe my ſelf, in adventuring to preſent your Lordſhip this Tranſlation; ſince not only my ſelf, but the whole World knows, that your early Loyalty, and Baniſhment for the Royal Cauſe, by your Retreat in <hi>France,</hi> have made you an abſolute Maſter of that Language, from whence it is borrowed: So that I could not but foreſee, That conſequently your Lordſhip is beſt able to diſtinguiſh, not only my own, but thoſe Imperfections, which of neceſſity muſt attend Copies, when compared with their Originals; there being in all Languages ſome Graces and Beauties of their Native <hi>Idiom,</hi> ſo peculiar to them, as are difficultly to be ſupplied, or tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Imitated by any other. But, My Lord, your Noble Character is too well known, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:64918:3"/>me to diſpair of Pardon; and ſince your Lordſhip is ſo publickly remarkable, for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Induſtry in Cultivating your Mind with all manner of Gentile Reading, it gives me hopes, that your Lordſhip will not be diſpleaſed to ſee thoſe generous Inclinations cheriſhed in others; and ſome Aſſiſtances and Invitations given to ſuch, whoſe Education hath not made them acquainted with Foreign Languages, whereby they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in the familiar Dreſs of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the advantage of what hath been written by Curious Pens of other Nations.</p>
            <p>However, My Lord, Gratitude, the only thing wherein I can be Liberal, as it obliges me to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate your Lordſhip's Name, as having received thoſe Favours from your Lordſhip, for which I muſt acknowledge my ſelf under ſuch Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as lying neareſt my Heart, will be forward to be upon my Lips; ſo it is impoſſible for me not to lay hold, even with ſome precipitation, upon the leaſt Occaſions, wherein I may, in any meaſure, Expreſs, what I do not only Eſteem ſo much a Duty, but alſo ſo great a Pleaſure to do my ſelf the Honour of telling the whole World, that I am,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is I think, if it be a miſtake, ſuch a one as is common to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind, to have that Opinion of their Sentiments, eſpecially thoſe of Pleaſure, to believe, that what they find diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and agreeable to themſelves, muſt be ſo likewiſe to others, what ever Inconveniences this may render men liable to in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I am not either curious to know, or at preſent to inquire, ſince I am aſſured that we are obliged to this Humour, for the Communication of many admirable things, in History eſpecially, which afford us both Pleaſure and Advantage; this being one of thoſe ſorts of Treaſures, which few People delight themſelves with hoarding up; but there being a certain pleaſure in pleaſing others, they are generally willing to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bountiful in what may inrich others without impoveriſhing themſelves. I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that it was this little Wheel, that gave me this Motion, and having ſome hours liberty, I could not be contented with diverting my ſelf, but muſt needs indeavour to propagate the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I found in this Hiſtory of <hi>Monſieur Maimbourg</hi>'s, that others might ſhare with me in it.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that many Perſons of good Judgment have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves againſt all kind of Tranſlations, except thoſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings, and ſome againſt thoſe too, as diſadvantageous to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and eſpecially to Induſtry, and indeavours to attain the knowledge of Languages. Now for my own particular, as I am ſatisfied that there are very few, who addict themſelves to the more difficult Studies of Learning or Languages, but ſuch, who either out of neceſſity, and upon the proſpect of their future advancement by ſuch attainments, as quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them for the great Imploies of Church or State; or ſuch, whoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Curioſity and Inclinations lead them to theſe reſearches, or will ever bend their Minds to the attainment of Languages; ſo I am confident that neither the natural deſires and thirſt of the one, nor the excited and neceſſary indeavours of the other, will ever be abated by Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſatisfied, but with the Originals; nor will they ever ſit down by the Streams, who can with eaſe and pleaſure draw Learning from its Fountains.</p>
            <p>Now there are a third ſort of People, who neither are compelled by neceſſity, nor inclined by Nature to give themſelves any great trouble in point of Learning; who yet, by Tranſlations of Learning into their own Language, may receive mighty Improvements in their Knowledge, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Conduct, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, and who may be thereby rendred ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable in their ſeveral Stations to their Prince and Country, agreeable in Converſation, and may likewiſe avoid the temptations of bestowing their ſpare hours upon ſuch Entertainments, to which, for want of Judgment, Experience, and more Innocent Diverſions, Nature, too much inclined to Vice and Folly, may be apt to tempt them, and
<pb facs="tcp:64918:4"/>there can be no doubt but many Perſons of great Natural Parts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, who have fallen under the misfortune of the Want of ſuch good Education as they might have had, as does but too frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to young Gentlemen, whom either the Flattery of their Maſters, Tutors, and Governors; the fond Indulgence of Parents and Guardians, or the neglect of both, betrayes into ſo great a want of Learning, as hardly to underſtand truly their own Native Language; theſe, I ſay when they come to ſee, and as I have known many of them deplore their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would want all manner of aſſiſtance, to cultivate and improve themſelves, which they might have by having Learning brought to them in an eaſie and familiar Language. Nor am I, if I could, to make an Invidious Catalogue of many Worthy Men, who by theſe little and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable helps have made ſuch attainments in neceſſary Knowledge, as have rendred them very ſerviceable to the World in Employs both Civil and Military, eſpecially the laſt.</p>
            <p>And indeed of all men living, the Martialiſts have generally the leaſt Inclination to Learning, though they can ſcarcely be good Soldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; For to them History is what the Seaman's Charts are in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. There they ſee the Reaſons of all thoſe great Events of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, the occaſions of the loſs and gaining of Battles, winning and looſing of Towns and Countries, Provinces and Kingdoms; there they have a view of the many Stratagems of War, divers of which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſuggest new ones to the Invention of the Ingenious; there they have the Spurs of Emulation in ſeeing the Heroick Actions of gallant men; ſometimes their own Anceſtors, whoſe Glory may excite their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, and whoſe Vertues may encourage them, whoſe Honours and Rewards may move them for the Service of their Prince and Country, to mount by the ſame Steps of Conduct, Bravery and Reſolution, to the top of Honour and Glory; and poſſibly had young <hi>Alexander</hi> never read the Stories of <hi>Achilles</hi> in his own Language, in the admirable Poem of <hi>Homer,</hi> he had never obtained either the Conqueſt he did, or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Surname of the <hi>Great,</hi> but had confined his Ambition, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards one World could not ſuffice, together with his Knowledge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow limits of his <hi>Macedon.</hi> And certainly as nothing can be more delightful to the Genius of a Soldier, than the repreſentation of great Actions, Battles, Sieges, honourable Retreats, admirable Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and regular Conducts, brave Performances, and the happy Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Ancient Hero's, ſo nothing can be more pleaſant in the time of Peace, or more ſerviceable to them in the time of War, than Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſo long as it is vailed under ſuch Languages as are ſtrangers to them, is like Treaſure in the Mine, for which no man is the Richer or the better.</p>
            <p>Nor is it of leſs advantage to the States-man, who will there find thoſe admirable Maxims and Inſtructions, of which he may moſt ſucceſsfully ſerve himſelf to his own Honour, and the advantage of thoſe by whom he is imployed. We in <hi>England,</hi> who have many Perſons, who are in ſome degree or other to be imployed in the Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs; ſuch as are Justices of the Peace, eſpecially in Corporations and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and ſuch as ſerve for the Repreſentatives of thoſe Places in the lower Houſe of Parliament, have reaſon to endeavour by all means to give them the opportunities of improving their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings in ſuch ways and meaſures as they are capable of, and as will make them capable
<pb facs="tcp:64918:4"/>of diſcharging thoſe Truſts to their own Reputation, the ſatisfaction of the King, and the advantage of their Country. For though many times it happens that the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, and others, who have opportunities of Learning fill thoſe Charges; yet it is not intailed upon them, and very frequently Perſons, to whom it is no diſparagement that they are not Scholars, their Education having been to Trades and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries neceſſary for the publick good of the Community, are choſen to thoſe Offices and Truſts. Now where men act in any publick Capacity, eſpecially in our Parliaments, whoſe good or ill Conduct never fails to have a like influence upon the whole Nation, it is of great advantage to have them in ſome meaſure acquainted with what is their own Intereſt, and that of thoſe whom they repreſent.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that gives them a better or clearer Proſpect in this matter than the Hiſtories of former Ages, both in their own and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, by which they will be informed of the great neceſſity of their Duty in Order to their own Happineſs. There they will ſee how happy thoſe Princes and People have been, who have had the good Fortune to live in good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding one with the other, and what fatal and dreadful Revolutions have happened upon Diſcords and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unions; and becauſe men are not apt to flatter the Aſhes of the Dead, we ſee impartially the Defects and Failings of paſt Ages, we diſcover the Secret Springs of thoſe Diſorders, which Popular, Ambitious, or Revengeful men have made uſe of in Councils, to raiſe Seditions and Rebellions againſt their Sovereigns, which whilst they lived, ſome would not, others durſt not diſcover, and, which they themſelves do always moſt ſtudiouſly indeavour to conceal. And theſe Remarks in History are like Light Houſes, Buoys and Beacons to Poſterity, to ſhew them a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Shoar, and to give them notice to ſtand aloof, and where they obſerve the ſame Practices, to fear the ſame Intentions, and avoid the like Miſchiefs and Dangers.</p>
            <p>And herein, as I cannot but applaud the Ingenuity and Induſtry of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, ſo I cannot but judge their procedure in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular worthy of our Notice. We are reputed in the World very fond of imitating thoſe People even to ridiculous extravagancy in Modes, Habits, and Dreſſes of the Body; and it were not amiſs if we could be perſwaded to follow their Examples and Faſhion in cultivating and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning of our Minds. It is the general and known obſervation, that as that Language within this fifty Years hath extended it felf farther than in five hundred before, ſo the <hi>French</hi> are moſt extraordinarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in all manner of Knowledge, and Learning, which may be of Publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Advantage. Nor can this be attributed to any other Cauſe, but the industrious care and diligence of the Learned and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Perſons of that Nation, who have with indefatigable application indeavoured to bring all the Learning of the World into their own Country, by making all the Writings of the <hi>Greeks, Latins, Italians,</hi> and ſeveral other Nations, who have been Famous in any ſort, Denizens of <hi>France,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aching them to ſpeak, ſome hundred Years ſince their Death, a Language to which they were Strangers whileſt they lived. Learning is the glorious Light of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, a Light which ſhews us not only how to guide our ſteps for the preſent, and the future, but leads us back into the darker times of Antiquity, and like the Perpetual Lamps ſo much admired, ſhews us the Beauties and the Lineaments of

For my own particular, I muſt declare my ſelf againſt ſuch a miſerable Covetouſneſs, which impoveriſhes a great many, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching the Miſers, who like Evil-Spirits ſit watching that Treaſure, which they neither can make uſe of themſelves, nor will permit others to poſſeſs, who would; and I could wiſh that all manner of gentile and ingenuous Learning, (for I do not ſpeak of that which is Sacred, which ought not to be prostituted or made ſo cheap, as to incourage idleneſs, or detract from the Majesty of the Schools, or of Theology) were as common as the Air we breath, or the Beams of that glorious Luminary, which bestows his pleaſing Influences upon all the World.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Hiſtory is the Ingenious <hi>Monſieur Maimbourg,</hi> a Writer of great Fame and Integrity, a Perſon of a ſolid Judgment, and every way a good Historian; and, which I admire most in him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Education and Profeſſion, a man that hath the leaſt of that fooliſh Bigotry, which never fails to render any Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ridiculous. He is a great Aſſertor of the Liberties of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church, and the Prerogatives of Princes againſt the pretended Supremacy of Popes, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of thoſe, who ſtile themſelves the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> upon the Temporal Power of Princes; and to me it is a mighty wonder to find a Romaniſt and a Jeſuit ſpeak ſo freely and ſo plain; and I doubt not, did not he, as well as many others of that Religion, labour under the hard prepoſſeſſions of Education, and the diſadvantages of prejudice, but they might be eaſily induced to throw off the Manacles, which Innovation hath laid upon them, and be perſwaded to ſee, how much the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath done towards restoring the Catholick Religion to its Primitive Antiquity, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthening it of the fooliſh Principles and ſuperstitious Practices, with which ſucceeding Ages have with more Zeal than Prudence, overloaden Religion: But this is not any part of my preſent Province, all that I have to ſay is to recommend this Hiſtorical Collection to the Reader; who, if he will but firſt pleaſe with a favourable Pen to correct the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Errors of the Preſs, which by reaſon of my diſtance from it, was not in my power to remedy, he will I hope receive the ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and poſſibly more advantage in reading it, than I have done in taking care to preſent it to him.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Great Men, whom I have the Honor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Majeſty, are the Hero's of theſe Famous <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who have ſeven ſeveral times armed all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> And poſſibly it may not be diſpleaſing to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to ſee the moſt valiant Princes of their times, and above all the Princes of your August, Conſanguinity, whom the Glory which they have acquired by a thouſand Gallant Actions, hath rendred Immortal. It is true, that their Arms have not had all that happy Succeſs, which they ſeemed to promiſe; and that thoſe of ſo many Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who united againſt them, have at laſt remained Victorious. But, Sir, after that which all the Earth hath ſeen with aſtoniſhment in this laſt Champaign, one may ſay, That there hath not been for this four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years and upwards, above one ſingle Hero, who is to be found in the Perſon of your Majesty, who hath been able to atchieve ſo great and Glorious an enterpriſe, and to triumph ſo gloriouſly over ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>And in truth all the Forces of the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the greatest part of the Circles of the Empire, and all thoſe of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> both by Sea and Land, are ſomething more formidable than thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> and nevertheleſs your Majeſty Commanding either your ſelf in Perſon, or cauſing your Orders to be executed by your Lieutenants, hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and diſſipated them all; you only, without the aſsiſtance of your Allies, who ſeemed as if they had taken Arms, only to be, with more Pomp and Ceremony, the ſpectators of your Victories.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64918:6"/>
            <p>This Wonder, Sir, is the moſt ſurprizing effect of a conſummated Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an Heroick Courage, accompanied with a Fortune always invincible, which may juſtly acquire you the moſt Glorious Surnames of your Predeceſſors, which your Majesty hath long ſince Merited by the Conquests of the preceding Campaigns, and by ſo many Royal Actions, as have in all things rendred the incomparable greatneſs of your Soul moſt eminently conſpicuous to the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>After this can it be doubted, but that if <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great had reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ages of theſe <hi>Cruſades,</hi> or if the Age of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> had been retarded, till the Raign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, we ſhould have ſeen at this Day, the Empire of Jeſus Chriſt re-eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> without having any need of the other Chriſtian Princes to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their Arms with his, otherwiſe than to celebrate his Triumphs?</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf, who have been always obliged to your Majeſty, by an inviolable Tye, both of my Duty and my Choice, and who have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be particularly your Creature, by the effects of your Royal Bounty, I am confident to ſay, that I ſhould make more noiſe than all the reſt, in ſuch an agreeable Concert. I hope alſo that I ſhall give ſome proofs to posterity, that I have the Idea of your Majeſty, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my Heart and Soul, that I ſhall always borrow ſome Lines from it, whether it be in the painting of my Hero's, who can never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo great, as when they come to be obſerved to have the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to reſemble your Majesty, or in recounting their admirable Actions, in ſuch places as they ſeem to imitate, though much ſhort of them, the Greatneſs of yours.</p>
            <p>This Testimony, Sir, of my Zeal for your Majeſtie's Glory, is no more than Truth, for ſo great a King; and tho' poſsibly it may be too little for ſo good a Master, yet ſince, in the condition wherein the Divine Providence hath placed me, it is all that I can do, to let the whole World understand, with how much Ardor, Submiſsion and Veneration, I am,</p>

            <head>An Advertiſement of the Author's to the Reader.</head>
            <p>AFTER what I have ſaid to the Reader in my Advertiſements to the Hiſtory of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> and that of the <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> I have not much to add, but only to inform him, that having drawn from the ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>French, Italians, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> almoſt all that I have written in this Hiſtory, I have not believed that I was obliged to cite the Modern Hiſtorians, who have ſaid ſomething of theſe <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have drawn them from the ſame Fountains which I have done. I have done the ſame thing in all my other Hiſtories, as where I recount the admirable Actions of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſeveral other Famous Saints. I have not produced for my Vouchers, <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes, Lipomannus, Surius, Ribadeneira,</hi> or the other Writers or Collectors, who have given us the Lives of the Saints, and much leſs the new Legend makers. For in thoſe places where we agree, it is not of them that I have made uſe, but of the Ancients from whom they have borrowed what they have Written, as well as I: and in other places where I am obliged to contradict them, as I am perſwaded that they are miſtaken, I could not ſpeak of them, but to refute their Errors. But that being neither agreeable to my Humor, nor to my Duty in the Quality of an Hiſtorian, and which would render me rather a Critick than an Hiſtorian. I have not troubled my ſelf, or the Reader, with what I believe is not by ingenious Perſons expected from me.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="author_to_the_reader">
            <head>A Second Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>WHAT I have to add to my firſt Advertiſement, is only for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe, who poſſibly may imagine, that the Portraicts and Characters which are to be ſeen in my Hiſtories, are rather like thoſe of Romances, the Deſigns of a Luxuriant Fancy, than of a Modeſt Truth, or at leaſt that like Paintings, they are done with the utmoſt advantage, and not without Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. But it will not be very difficult for me, to deſtroy an Imagination ſo little conformable to reaſon, and I have nothing to do, but to deſire the Reader to remove his prejudice, by looking into the Authors, whom I have cited in the Margins, over againſt theſe Portraicts, and there they ſhall find the Originals from which I have honeſtly copied them. They may alſo obſerve as well as I, that I have not contented my ſelf with one Author, but have drawn them from divers put together, the Shape, the Colour, the Complexion, the Mind, the Hair, the Beard, the Eyes, the Noſe, the Mouth, and the Lineaments, as well as the manners of ſuch whom I have undertaken to paint, and to ſhew them to the Reader, ſuch as good Hiſtorians have repreſented them, herein following the Examples of <hi>Plutarch, Suetonius, Saluſt,</hi> and a hundred other Famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius, Nicephorus, Victor,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Ammianus Marcellinus, Jornandus,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Deacon, have furniſhed me in the Hiſtory of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> with the Portraicts of my Hero's, <hi>Romans, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theophanes, Cedrenus, Zonaras, Michael Glycas, Eginhardus, Anaſtaſius,</hi> the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary keeper, <hi>Paul</hi> the Deacon, <hi>Marcardus Freherus, El-Macim,</hi> and the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Chronicle, have made me acquainted with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Saraſins,</hi> whoſe Pictures I ſhew in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Iconoclaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> the Monk, the Abbot of <hi>Nogent,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Sugerius, Otho Friſingenſis, Otho de</hi> St. <hi>Blaiſe,</hi> the old <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Tyre, Nicetas,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſperg, Cuſpinian,</hi> and ſeveral others, are the Authors, from whoſe Works I have furniſhed my ſelf, to repreſent to the Life the Illuſtrious Men of
<pb facs="tcp:64918:7"/>my <hi>Cruſades,</hi> to which I have added nothing more than the manner of expreſſing their thoughts in my own Words.</p>
            <p>And it would have been very eaſy for me to verifie this, by citing the very Words of the Authors, from whom I draw my Portraicts, as in the third and fourth Tome, I have placed in the Margin thoſe of St. <hi>Anthonine,</hi> and of two or three others, who have given us the Picture of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second. But I have nevertheleſs declined it, being unwilling to make the Margin ſwell bigger than the Book it ſelf. If theſe Writers ſay nothing of the lineaments of the Face, or the reſt of the Perſon of thoſe of whom I write, I take care to ſay nothing, and content my ſelf with deſcribing the qualities of the Soul, the Mind and the Heart, witneſs the Portraicts of <hi>Luitprandus,</hi> the Emperor's <hi>Nicephorus, Michael</hi> the ſtammering, <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Angelus.</hi> But when they give me In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as do many Famous Hiſtorians, whom I give for my Warrantees, I cannot conceal this knowledge from my Readers, and if poſterity hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to every one of theſe Hiſtorians in particular, for having given every one of them ſome particular ſtroak of theſe extraordinary Men, who have made ſuch a Figure in the World, I am not without hopes, but it may be very well pleaſing to them, that I have taken care to Collect and Unite all theſe ſcattered Draughts, to compoſe thoſe juſt Portraicts, which they may with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſee in my Works.</p>
            <p>For it hath ever been and ever will be, that Mankind will have the Curioſity to know thoſe Perſons, who are reported to have done ſo many great and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things. And for this reaſon it is, that at this time more than ever, there is ſuch curious ſearch made for Ancient Medals, which make up the faireſt part of the Cabinets, even of Kings and Princes; there being a great pleaſure to ſee the Faces of thoſe Perſons, of whoſe Fortune and Actions we read in Hiſtory. And as there hath been lately a Medal of the King made with ſuch perfection, that nothing can be added to it, it will hereafter be ſought for, with as much Paſſion by the Curious, as are thoſe of the Ancient <hi>Caeſars.</hi> For moſt certainly in reading all the ſurprizing Wonders, which the Hiſtory of his Raign, written by an able hand, muſt publiſh, though far ſhort of what they are in reality, one muſt be touched with a mighty deſire to ſee that Auguſt Face, wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable greatneſs of his Soul, and all the Royal Vertues are ſo well expreſſed, by that Heroick Air and thoſe admirable traces of Majeſty, which will not ſuffer any that ſee them to heſitate one Moment, but that they muſt acknowledge him to be the greateſt and moſt admirable of all Monarchs.</p>
            <p>After this I hope that all reaſonable Perſons will be ſatisfied with my Conduct, which will incourage me to purſue, in my following Hiſtory of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> the Characters of thoſe Popes, Emperors, Princes, Kings, and Great Men, who are to appear upon the Theatre of the following Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>IF ever any Undertaking were capable of poſſeſſing the Hiſtorian with a juſt fear of defeating the mighty Expectation of his Reader, moſt aſſuredly it may be apprehended in attempting the Deſign of relating the enſuing Hiſtory of the <hi>Cruſade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed amidſt all the moſt extraordinary Revolutions which may be found either in the Eſtabliſhment of New, or the Ruine of the Ancient Monarchies, one ſhall difficultly meet with any thing more memorable; and whether we conſider the Vaſtneſs and Importance of this Famous Enterprize of the <hi>Cruſado's,</hi> or the Quality of the Perſons who have fortunately executed, or unſucceſsfully attempted this great Deſign; whether we compute the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or variety of thoſe extraordinary Events which were accompanied with ſuch diverſity of Fortune; or, in ſhort, if we take a Survey of thoſe Heroick Actions which were then performed, one ſhall find them ſuch, as not ſcarcely to be out-done even by the Romantick Atchievements of the Fabulous Ages.</p>
                  <p>One ſhall there ſee the Holy Wars, which the Chriſtians have undertaken either to reconquer or preſerve a Country wherein all the glorious Myſteries of the Redemption of Mankind were accompliſhed; and which the Worſhippers of the Eternal Son of God Jeſus Chriſt did believe that they could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infamy and betraying the Intereſt of their Religion, permit to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyrannick Dominion of Barbarous Infidels.</p>
                  <p>On the one Part, three of the greateſt Kings of <hi>France:</hi> as many Emperours, the Kings of <hi>England, Denmark, Hungary, Navar</hi> and <hi>Cyprus;</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain, Normandy, Austria</hi> and <hi>Suabia,</hi> and moſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the head of their Troops, being followed by whatever was brave or gallant throughout all the Weſtern Monarchies: on the other ſide the Sultans of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with all the celebrated Princes of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſens,</hi> who have rendred their names ſo famous by the greatneſs of their Actions, are the <hi>Hero's</hi> who muſt tread the ſtage of this Hiſtory, perſons ſo conſiderable, that ſingly they might furniſh a very fair Volume. All that is ſurprizing in unexpected ſucceſſes, all that is ſo admirably repreſented in Fiction, or wonderful in the moſt Heroick Enterpriſes, will be found in the following Account, and to render it yet more valuable will be accompanied with that ſolid foundation of Truth, which will diſtinguiſh it from thoſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Fictions which have been invented with ſo much pain, to produce ſome pleaſure to the Readers.</p>
                  <p>That I may therefore endeavour that this Hiſtory may in ſome ſort appear new, and with all its natural Ornaments, at leaſt that it may not want that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beauty which even the moſt indifferent Relations ſeem to challenge; it is to be conſidered that though theſe matters have been often heretofore related, either in ſome parts by particular Authors, or in the general Hiſtories of ſuch Natures as have had more or leſs concern in this affair of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> yet the World hath not hitherto ſeen them wrought together into one Regular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64918:12"/>with all the dependencies, conſequencies and connexions, nor with that continued Chain of Cauſes and Effects, and ſuch Circumſtances as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work ſo accompliſhed and delicate as it ought to be; and in which the charming ſecret which doth ſo inſenſibly allure and pleaſe, conſiſts; and which is indeed the ſoul and ſpirit of Hiſtory, and ought to be the End of every juſt Hiſtorian.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as the Subject is ſo Noble and agreeable, ſo neither is it leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious then delightful; For here one ſhall find the great Concerns of the Church, of two mighty Empires, and the Principal Eſtates of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> there ſhall one diſcover the cauſes which occaſioned that glorious deſign ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to fall, and yet afterwards to riſe again: there may we ſee that Zeal of our Anceſtors which ſeems to reproach our ſlow imitation; Eſpecially at a time when the Forces of one ſingle Monarch, could he but remain aſſured of his Neighbours, are ſufficient to ruine the Tyranny of thoſe Infidels, whoſe power conſiſts chiefly in thoſe fatal diviſions among Chriſtians, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have prevented their employing their Arms to their deſtruction. However the hope that my endeavours will not be unprofitable, and that God Almighty whoſe help I implore will aſſiſt me with his Grace, and beſtow that happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which is not to be expected from me, have given me encouragement to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this difficult task which I have undertaken.</p>

about the Year 1093. took a Voyage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſatisfie his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the Sacred Monuments of the Redemption of mankind. Being arrived there, he underſtood from his Hoſt the miſerable condition to which the Chriſtians were reduced; and having taken a view himſelf of the piteous eſtate of that deſolate City, he reſolved to confer with the Patriarch <hi>Simeon,</hi> not only to receive a more perfect Information of the truth of thoſe Particulars, but alſo to deliberate with him, concerning ſome means of delivering the People of God from their cruel Servitude. The Patriarch who quickly perceived the virtuous inclinations and brisk temper of the Hermite, opened to him his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul, he recounted to him in moſt paſſionate Language the innumerable and horrible Sacriledges, which were by the Infidels daily committed within the moſt Holy Places, and the inſupportable miſeries which not only the poor Chriſtians, but the Patriarchs themſelves who were treated like Slaves, had been forced to indure under their tyrannous and barbarous Lords, by the ſpace of five hundred years. After which with many bitter Sighs he gave him to underſtand, that conſidering the lamentable eſtate of the Eaſtern Empire, the Evils which they ſuffered were not only inſupportable, but without all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Redreſs, unleſs they might hope for Aſſiſtance from the Weſt. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was moſt ſenſibly touched with the Diſcourſe of the Patriarch,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1093</label> and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of which he was an Eye-witneſs himſelf, being immediately filled with an extraordinary Zeal for the Publick Good, made no difficulty to aſſure the Patriarch that he doubted not in the leaſt, but if the Pope and the Chriſtian Princes of the Weſt were truly informed of the deplorable condition of the Chriſtians in the Holy Land, that they would unite in a generous Reſolution to break off the Manacles of their Slavery, and deliver the Holy Places from the tyrannick Yoke of the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore he adviſed the Patriarch to write effectually to them and implore the Succour of their Arms, upon which the only Hopes of the Deliverance of the Chriſtians of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> could depend; and for his own particular he very couragiouſly offered to carry thoſe Lords throughout the Weſt, and to do all the Good Offices he was capable of towards the exciting of the Chriſtian Princes to undertake an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſo glorious, ſo neceſſary for the Honor, and the Common Intereſt and good of all Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simeon</hi> ſurprized with the Reſolution and Courage of the Hermite, which he obſerved to be accompanied alſo with ſo much Wiſdom, was ſtruck with a ſtrong Impulſe, that God Almighty was reſolved to deliver his People in ſuch a manner as ſhould redound moſt to his own Glory, ſince the Inſtrument which he made uſe of for the accompliſhment of ſuch a marvellous Work, carried ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion to the Greatneſs of ſo high and ſo hardy an Enterpriſe; for in Truth <hi>Peter</hi> carried nothing promiſing in his Perſon, which might make it be believed that he was like to be a proper Negotiator of an Affair of that Importance; for he was ſmall of Stature, and not well proportioned neither, his Aſpect was by no means agreeable, and he was far from ſweetning by Art thoſe ruder Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Viſage, inſomuch that by the little care he took, in which others beſtow ſo much pains, to make himſelf appear tolerable, he rather reſembled ſome ſavage Creature, his hair diſordered, his Beard long and long neglected; and conſidering the Auſterity of his Life, his ill ſhape and the meanneſs of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, thoſe who were not accuſtomed to make very curious and penetrating diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64918:13"/>could not but make a very diſadvantagious Judgement of him; But coming more narrowly to conſider him, it was eaſie to diſcover, that as he had been very ſtudious in all ſorts of Learning, ſo he had made very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in his Mind, and that together with a ſolid Judgement he had a great Mind, an admirable Reſolution to attempt, and a marvellous Vivacity in the ready Execution of what he had reſolved; that he was Maſter of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eloquence, capable of perſwading what he pleaſed without Artifice; and, in ſhort, there appeared in his Eyes a fire ſo quick and ſparkling, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo Noble in his Air and Mine, as was ſufficient to convince one that there dwelt a great Soul in that little Body.</p>

The Natural Generoſity of a Perſon of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage who had voluntarily engaged himſelf in an Enterpriſe ſo great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, was ſufficient of it ſelf to remove all the fear which might be apprehended in the Execution; but however he was ſtrongly perſwaded, that ſince Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeemed ſo extraordinarily engaged, nothing was able to ſurmount the Divine Power, and that therefore he might be confident of a happy and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Concluſion of this Affair. <hi>Peter</hi> now reſolved to put in Execution what he had promiſed the Patriarch <hi>Simeon,</hi> the Evening before his departure ſhut himſelf up in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, there to paſs the night in Prayer, with all his Soul to implore the Succor of Almighty God upon ſuch an important occaſion; and after his Devotions falling aſleep, whether it were that his imagination violently prepoſſeſſed with his intended Enterpriſe, acted upon his Soul more vigorouſly during his ſleep than while he was awake, or that God was pleaſed to make uſe of a Dream to reveal his pleaſure to him as formerly he had to the Holy Prophets, in his ſleep there ſeemed to appear to him Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a Condition as he was when he aroſe from the Sepulchre, who coming towards him and ſoftly jogging him, ſaid, <hi>Ariſe</hi> Peter <hi>and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go about the Charge Impoſed on thee, I will be ever with thee; It is high time that the Sanctity of theſe places Conſecrated by my Preſence ſhould ceaſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, and that I ſhould deliver my People from the Cruel Servitude under which they have for ſo many Ages groaned.</hi> The Hermite preſently thereupon awaking, felt, or at leaſt believed he felt upon his Soul the Effects of an Impreſſion, far different from what Common Dreams are wont to leave upon the Mind, and therefore doubted not but Jeſus Chriſt had thus appeared to him to give him an immediate Commiſſion from his own Mouth. This Belief which did ſo firmly Eſtabliſh it ſelf in his Soul, would permit him no longer to doubt the Truth of it was ſuch a new Confirmation of the Truth of the Heavenly Viſion,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1093</label> that adding new Fire to his Flame, it produced in his Heart the Courage of a Hero, inſomuch that he believed there was nothing able to reſiſt his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. So that without delaying a moment, having received the Benediction of the Patriarch, he went to imbarque upon the firſt Merchants Ship which he ſhould meet, which in a few days he did, and happily arrived at the Port of <hi>Bari,</hi> from whence he proceeded to the Court of the <hi>Pope.</hi>

For this <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> who had not only a great Mind, but a large Fond of Piety and Religion, but had alſo been the great Confident of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh,
<label type="milestone">

He was reſolved himſelf in Perſon to march at the Head of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of whom above fifty thouſand had liſted themſelves, and were ready to march under his Conduct; but the jealouſie which he had of the ill Deſigns of the Emperor who refuſed to joyn with him in this Sacred Expedition, obliged him to break thoſe Meaſures, and to apply himſelf to the defence of the Church which was in Extream Hazzard of being oppreſſed by the Avarice and Violence of that Prince. But <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> who had as much Courage and better Fortune than <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Obſtacle of the Schiſm being now removed, reſolved ſtrongly to undertake an Enterpriſe ſo illuſtrious, ſo advantagious to the Glory of God, ſo neceſſary to the good of all Chriſtendom, and which would render his name venerable, and his Pontificate Memorable to all Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>He therefore gave the Hermite a favourable Reception, and granted him long Audiences, the better to inform himſelf of the Exact Poſture of the Eaſtern Affairs, and the Forces of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſens</hi> which he was to oppoſe. And as he quickly diſcovered the great Qualities of this little man whoſe Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made yet ſmaller promiſes, perceiving alſo his Addreſs, good Senſe, and the Conduct he had to manage this great Affair, together with the Courage and Reſolution with which he Eſpouſed the Deſign, he was not long before he determined, to make uſe of him alone for the carrying on what ever was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Deſign till it was fit for him publickly to appear in it. And therefore ſending for the Hermit, he opened his very heart to him, in ſuch terms as made it evident that he had as violent a Paſſion for the deliverance of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Infidels, as the Patriarch himſelf who had imployed him in that Negotiation. He promiſed him that he would imploy all the Intereſt he had in Heaven and Earth, his Forces, his Revenue, his Reputation, and all his Pontifical Authority to form a Holy League of all the Weſtern Princes, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Infidels who ſo cruelly tyrannized over the Chriſtians in the Eaſt. But withal he informed him, that before he proceeded any further, it was convenient that he who had begun this great Affair, ſhould endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Minds of the People in all the Countries both on this and the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> by publiſhing to them thoſe things which he had with ſo much Zeal and Paſſion related to him.</p>
                  <p>There are few Examples to be produced comparable to this, which makes it appear how one ſingle Perſon was able to move the whole Earth by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Conduct and Reſolution in purſuing a Holy Enterpriſe which he had formed with ſo much Generoſity, Zeal and Courage: and whether it were the Extream Paſſion which the Hermit had to ſee the Deſign ſucceed and proſper, that rendred his Arguments perſwaſive beyond the Power of his own Genius though Naturally Eloquent; or whether the Splendor of ſo grat a Deſign daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Fears, and tranſported his Mind with a Paſſion for ſuch a Novelty as carried all the Charms of Honorable and Excellent; or rather that God who had choſen this Inſtrument to manifeſt his Power and his Glory acted by him more Efficaciouſly upon the Hearts of men which are in his Hands to diſpoſe of as he pleaſeth, moſt certain it is, that never any ſingle and ſo inconſiderable a Cauſe produced ſuch ſuddain ſurprizing, and wonderful Effects: for in leſs than one Year in which the Hermit by the Popes Command applyed himſelf to this <hi>Affair,</hi> he travelled over the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> treated in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular with moſt of the Princes, <label type="milestone">

And for this purpoſe he choſe thoſe Methods which he judged moſt proper and proportionate to the Importance of an Affair of this Nature and the Sovereign Majeſty of the Pontificate, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling two famous Councils particularly to deliberate upon this Affair; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he made uſe of other publick Allegations, which were ſufficient to give a colourable reaſon for thoſe great aſſemblies; particularly the deplorable Schiſms which had for ſo long time rent the Church, and introduced ſo many horrible abuſes which ſtood need of Redreſs, and the power of the evil Party being much abated, principally in <hi>Lombardy</hi> where the Schiſmaticks had committed the greateſt diſorders, ſeemed to expect it.</p>

We have indeed humbled the Power of the Schiſm, we have

Yes, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Holy Land, the City of God, the Inheritance of Chriſt Jeſus which he hath beſtowed upon his Children, having taken it out of the Hands of</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Pagans, <hi>that admirable Spot of Ground where the Saviour of the World wrought all the ſtupendious Myſteries of the Salvation of Mankind, the very Heart of Chriſtendom, as I may term it, has for many Ages been uſurped by the Infidels, by the</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Saracens; <hi>and we permit them inſolently to triumph even over Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, if I may ſo ſay, whom they ſeem to have chaſed out of the Capital City of his Empire, whileſt they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their cruel Tyranny, upon the Ruins of ſo many Sacred Monuments of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Conqueſts. What Tongue is able to expreſs the fearful Prophanations which are daily committed in thoſe Holy Places which the Actions, the Miracles, the Blood and Sufferings of the Saviour of the world have Conſecrated, and made Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all Chriſtians, who from every quarter of the Earth reſort thither to pay their Religious Devotions, as if Chriſt Jeſus himſelf were there perſonally preſent. And if amidſts the horrible marks of their Impiety, the overthrowing our Temples and our Altars, theſe Inſidels have ſpared the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, we are obliged for that good Office to the Avarice of theſe Inhumane Robbers, who have impoſed an Exceſſive Rate upon the Devotion of the Faithful Chriſtians, whom though they cannot rob of their Faith, they deſpoil of their Goods, and many times by inſufferable torments take away their Lives. And all this time the Chriſtians of the Weſt, of whom one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Nation were ſufficientlyable to Infranchiſe the Eaſt from this unworthy Servitude, Coldly and without being moved behold the Oppreſſion of their Brethren; as if they had no manner of ſhare in the Injury which theſe Barbarians do to Jeſus Chriſt, whileſt they invade that Inheritance which ſolely appertains to Chriſtians who are his Children, we ſuffer them peaceably to enjoy a Conqueſt ſo ſhameful to all Chriſtendom whileſt we lye buried in unimployed Lazineſs without a ſingle thought of running to our Arms.

                  <p>And here, as he was about to purſue his Diſcourſe, he was Interrupted by the Exclamations and Crys of an infinite number of People, who with Tears in their Eyes, beating their Breaſts with their Hands, and with their Eyes lift up to Heaven, cried out from all parts of the Aſſembly unanimouſly, as it were by a common Conſent, <hi>It is the Will of God, It is the Will of God.</hi> The Pope, who reſolved to make Advantage of this generous Heat, riſing from his Throne, and after a long time having obtained the Silence, which by his Geſture he Commanded: He proteſted, <hi>That there could not be a more manifeſt Teſtimony of the Pleaſure of Heaven, than this Exclamation, which proceeding from ſo many Mouths, could not be ſuppoſed to ſpeak the ſame Language, without being animated by the Spirit of God: That for his part he received it as an Oracle, which promiſed all happy Succeſs to this Holy War.</hi> He alſo added, <hi>That he thought it ſit that a Word of ſo happy a Preſage ſhould be the Motto which ſhould be wrought in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Standards of the Army, and that it ſhould be the Word the Souldiors and Captains ſhould make uſe of in their Combats, to animate each other to perform vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and to give thereby a Promiſe of aſſured Victory. And in ſhort, that thoſe who would follow Chriſt Jeſus in taking up the Croſs in this Holy Expedition, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol themſelves in this devout Militia, ſhould wear a Red Croſs upon their right Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as a Mark of Diſtinction, to ſhew that they had the Honor to ſerve under him who had overcome all Enemies by the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, in the other Seſſions, ſeveral new Decrees were made in Favour of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and upon the whole matter of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truce,</hi> againſt thoſe horrible Diſorders which in this time had waſted the Church, which indeed were ſo great, that it is with great Injuſtice that ſome Perſons do ſo violently prefer the paſt Ages before the preſent. For ſo little regard had Men then to Laws, and ſo Powerleſs was Juſtice, that every particular Perſon took the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do what he pleaſed, by force of Armes, and to uſurp that incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Right of Soveraigns; inſomuch that moſt of the Realms of <hi>Europe</hi> were miſerably Ruined by the particular Animoſities of private Perſons, every one to revenge the Injuries which he believed he had received, having an immediate recourſe to right himſelf by Arms, and to thoſe extremities of Violence, that they ſpared not with Fire and Sword to manifeſt their Reſentments againſt the Houſes, Lands, and Perſons of their Enemies. Now to apply ſome kind of Remedy to theſe horrible Miſchiefs, which it was impoſſible totally to repreſs in an inſtant; the Biſhops and Barons of <hi>France</hi> did firſt, and after their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, thoſe of other Realms made a Decree, by which, Churches, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Monaſteries, and the Religious Orders, Women, Merchants, Labourers, and Mills, were abſolutely protected from theſe Violences; and this was called the <hi>Peace.</hi> And for other matters, it was abſolutely prohibited to commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Diſorders from <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Eve, till <hi>Monday</hi> Morning; and this was out of the particular Reſpect which was thought due to thoſe Days which Chriſt Jeſus had Conſecrated by the laſt Myſteries of his Life, and this was called the <hi>Truce;</hi> and the Violators of either of theſe Decrees were publickly pronounced Excommunicate, and condemned either to Baniſhment or Death, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Quality of the Violences they were guilty of. This Decree was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Confirmed by four Councils, which made ſome further Addition in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truce,</hi> as may be ſeen under thoſe Titles in the Decretals; ſo that if one did but religiouſly obſerve the Truce as to the Days enjoyned, this brutiſh War amongſt private Perſons, was ſo far Tolerated, that it paſſed for Juſt and Legitimate, provided any Perſon ſent his Enemy a Challenge in a regular way: and this continued in <hi>France</hi> for above two hundred Years, till ſuch time as, after <hi>Lewis</hi> the Saint had to little Purpoſe attempted to remedy it, <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth put a Period to this Miſchief by the Edict of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> in the Year 1303.</p>
                  <p>Now as theſe Diſorders were at this time thus Tolerated, in regard it was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64918:16"/>probable they would prove a mighty Hindrance to this Holy Voyage, becauſe Mens Eſtates during their Abſence, would be expoſed to the Injuries of their Enemies, therefore the Council in the firſt place, Confirmed the Decree of the Peace and Truce, with reſpect to all ſorts of Perſons, and that by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle theſe Abuſes of the Wars between private Perſons might be taken away, which by reaſon of their long Continuance could not poſſibly be effected at once, this Council prolonged the time of the Truce, adding to thoſe four days of the Week formerly decreed, all the time of the <hi>Advent,</hi> till the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> and between <hi>Septuageſima</hi> Sunday till the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and from the <hi>Rogation</hi> Week till the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Whit</hi>-Sunday. But for the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> they were under Protection during the whole time of their Service, ſo that their Perſons and Eſtates were priviledged till their return from the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope alſo granted his Indulgences, and the Remiſſion of all thoſe Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which had been incurred by the Breach of the Canons.

                  <p>A Writer of that time, who was at the Council, and afterwards in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land,</hi> aſſures us, that having ſtrictly obſerved the time, and examined the matter, he was informed from many Perſons of different Places, that the very ſame day wherein the Pope publiſhed the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> the News was known in the remoteſt places both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt;</hi> which made ſuch a ſtrange Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon Mens Spirits, who either were, or believed they were ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed to engage themſelves in this heroick Enterpriſe, that when the Biſhops came to preach up the Croſs, and to excite the People to take it up, they found them ſo prediſpoſed, that an infinite number of Perſons of all Ranks, Qualities and Conditions throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>France,</hi> immediately entred into it; and ſuch was the Fervour with which the Deſign was embraced, that no ſort of Conſiderations of worldly Honour, Intereſt, or Pleaſure, no Delicacy of Education, nor Bonds of Friendſhip were able to retard Men, but they generouſly broke all thoſe little Chains, to enter into the more glorious Bonds of the Solemn Vow of the <hi>Cruſade.</hi> Here might you ſee Friends encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging one another, and entring into this new Amity, making mutual Promiſes never to abandon each other; there Enemies Embracing and Religiouſly Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt inviolably to maintain the Truce; nay even the weeping Ladys, who ſaw themſelves ready to be Divorced from their Beloved Husbands and deareſt Children, yet did not ceaſe to encourage them to purſue this glorious Enterprize, and many of them had the Courage to take a ſhare with them, and reſolved to follow them notwithſtanding all the fearful Dangers, and inſinite Hazards and Hardſhips which were to be expected from ſo long and painful a Voyage.</p>
                  <p>Moſt certain it is, that as there is nothing ſo Perfect or Holy, which is not ſubject to be abuſed either by the Weakneſs or Miſchievouſneſs of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo in the beginning of this Holy War, there happened ſo many ſtrange Diſorders, as might well have rendered the Event of this Enterpriſe moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous, if God Almighty himſelf had not appeared Ingaged in it, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as even againſt all Appearance, by a kind of Miracle, to bring it to that glorious Iſſue, which was not reaſonably to be expected from any inferior Power. For an innumerable company of Peaſants, with their Wives and Children, which they carried in their Carts, abandoning their laborious Tillage, would alſo have a part in this Voyage, which was commonly called <hi>Gods Voyage;</hi> ſo that all the Mobile of the Realm, who upon this occaſion entertained a Hope
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64918:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>of bettering their Fortunes, mingling with thoſe who had undertaken the Croſs, ſerved to no other purpoſe but to put all into Diſorder and Confuſion; Nor was it poſſible to give Bounds to this tumultuary Rabble, who to authoriſe their Actions, had ſo fair a Colour and Pretext of Piety. So that the ſmalleſt Number were thoſe whom the Conſideration of the Glory of the Chriſtian Name, or the Service of God obliged to follow this Deſign; but too many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves in it, ſome out of Vanity and Affectation, others out of a lightneſs of Spirit; theſe for the Pleaſure they propoſed in the Voyage, thoſe to accompany their Friends and Acquaintance, and many to free themſelves from the Importunity of their Creditors, or to enjoy the benefit of the Truce. Great Numbers alſo of Monks and other Religious Perſons, weary of their Profeſſion and Solitude, abandoned their Cloiſters and their Cells, and out of the Love of Liberty, took up the Croſs in a different manner than that which they had obliged themſelves to by their Vow, and made uſe of the falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Zeal to Religion, to violate one Vow by entring into another, which they had no Power to do; ſo that the Abbots to prevent a greater Miſchief, were obliged to permit the Monks to follow the Army of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> ſince they were not able to hinder them who had gotten ſuch a ſpecious Pretence, as was the Satisfaction of their ardent Deſire which they ſeemed to have, to take their Part in the Deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Women wanting in their little Cheats; for they, to make it be believed that they were by extraordinary Ways called by God to this Voyage, invented thoſe glittering Illuſions which ſome believe have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in our time upon other Occaſions; for having found a way by the Juice of Herbs, to form certain little Croſſes upon their Bodies, reſembling thoſe which the <hi>Cruſades</hi> wore upon their Habits, with an impudent Malice they ſhewed them to every body, as if they had been the miraculous Impreſſions of the Divine Power. There were others, who with no leſs Hypocriſie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an Exceſs of ill govern'd Devotion, or by an indiſcreet Fervour to gain a fooliſh Glory by a vain Oſtentation of their Zeal, burnt Croſſes upon their Bodies with red hot Irons, which they ſhewed with more affectation and ſeeming Pleaſure, than thoſe who wore them upon their Habits, Embroidered in Gold and Silver, could ſhew theirs. So that Illuſion, Hypocriſy, Vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Indiſcretion, the Peſts of Virtue and true Piety, corrupted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned thoſe Actions, which otherwiſe might have been eſteemed the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Heroick.</p>
                  <p>But that which prevented theſe Diſorders from being ſo Miſchievous as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways they might have been, was the great number of great Captains, Gentlemen, Lords and Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> who followed the Princes who were of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and were joynt Commanders in this famous Enterpriſe, yet without pretending to have any Superiority of Power one over the other, which made it apparent that God only was their Conductor and General.</p>
                  <p>The Princes then, whoſe Names ſhall be eternally Reverenced by Poſterity, and who have acquired immortal Glory in all Hiſtory, were <hi>Hugh</hi> the great Earl of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt of <hi>France, Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders, Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and St. <hi>Giles, Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with his Brothers <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Euſtace, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Earl of <hi>Chartres</hi> and <hi>Blois, Hugh</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Lords of the firſt Quality, who ſhall hereafter more commodiouſly be made known, when Occaſion ſhall preſent their noble Actions, and when I come to deſcribe, as I am about to do, the Voyage which they made by three ſeveral Ways, according as before they had agreed in the Winter, in order to their Rendevouzing at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as they did the following Year.

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1096</label> which ſhe had Cultivated alſo by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence very uncommon to her Sex, which ſhe had employed in the Study of all curious Learning; and in truth, ſhe was a Princeſs of moſt admirable Virtue, and of a Piety ſo reſplendent, that after her death ſhe obtained the glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid alſo that by the Aſſiſtance of Divine Illumination, ſhe did predict the future Greatneſs of her three Sons, <hi>Eustace, Godfrey,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin.</hi> For one Day as the Earl her Husband demanded of her what ſhe had hid in her Lap, ſhe being playing with the Children, ſhe very ſeriouſly anſwered, that ſhe had there three great Princes, one Duke, one King, and one Earl, which was afterwards Veriſied in the admirable Fortunes of theſe three Princes. For <hi>Godfrey</hi> was Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and King of <hi>Jeruſalem; Baldwin</hi> was King of the ſame Realm, and Prince of <hi>Edeſſa;</hi> and <hi>Euſtace,</hi> whom ſome will have to be the eldeſt Brother, was Earl of <hi>Bullen</hi> after the Death of his Father. It is alſo added that ſhe had a ſtrange Dream before the Birth of Prince <hi>Godfrey,</hi> for the Sun ſeemed to deſcend from his Heavenly Orb and to fall into her Lap, and that ſhe ſaw her little Son Enthroned in the midſt of that Glorious Luminary; but it is the Humor of ſome Writers to render the Nativities of great Men more Illuſtrious, at leaſt as they think, by Prodigies and Revelations, which after, wards the Noble Actions of theſe Hero's make eaſily to paſs for real Truths eſpecially with Perſons who love to divert themſelves with matters very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and Surprizing.</p>
                  <p>But this is moſt certain, which the Counteſs herſelf with a great deal of Pleaſure was uſed to relate, after the glorious Succeſs which her Sons had in the <hi>Holy War,</hi> that long before there was the leaſt Diſcourſe of the <hi>Cruſade, Prince Godfrey</hi> was uſed to ſay, that he would one day take a Voyage to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> but not as the poor Pilgrims did, only to ſatisfy his Devotion, but as a Captain and a Conqueror, at the head of a Puiſſant Army to Chaſe the wicked Inſidels from that Holy Place. Which muſt needs proceed ſingly from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64918:18"/>of his Courage, and which conſidering the Condition of his Fortune, very unfit to execute ſo great a Deſign, may very well paſs for a Prophetick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and looks like a Preſage of that Glory and good Fortune which God had allotted for him, and in order to which he ſeemed beforehand to prepare him by a thouſand Beautiful Actions wherein he acquired a moſt Illuſtrious Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Death of the Duke his Unckle, the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth who pretended that the Dutchy of the Lower <hi>Lorrain</hi> for want of Heirs Male of the Houſe of <hi>Ardenna</hi> was devolved to him, conferred it upon his Son <hi>Conrade,</hi> leaving nothing to <hi>Godfrey</hi> beſides the Marquiſate of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> And on the other ſide <hi>Albert</hi> Earl of <hi>Namur</hi> his Kinſman, and <hi>Thiery</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> attempted to take from him <hi>Bullen</hi> and <hi>Verdun:</hi> So that this Prince who was not yet Seventeen years of Age, was compelled to have recourſe to an early Valour for the Recovery of one part and the Defence of the other part, of his Inheritance. And therefore putting himſelf into the Caſtle of <hi>Bullen,</hi> which <hi>Albert</hi> aſſiſted by the Forces of the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun</hi> had beſieged, he ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly repulſed his Enemies in all their attacks, that he forced them to a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Retreat after they had loſt the better part of their Army; and in the ſame quarrel he undertook a ſingle Combat againſt the ſaid Earl, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperor and his whole Court; during the Combat he had the Misfortune in making a notable Blow at the Head of his Enemy, to break his Sword ſhort within half a foot of the Hilt; but notwithſtanding this Diſaſter, it was impoſſible to perſwade him to determine the difference upon ſuch terms of accommodation as upon this occaſion were tendred to him, but purſuing his point he fought with redoubled Ardor, till at length having tumbled down his Enemy with a mighty Blow which he gave him with the Pommel of his Sword upon his head; being now a Conquerer he accepted that Agreement which before he had generouſly refuſed, whileſt being diſarmed he ran the utmoſt hazzard of being Vanquiſhed. And afterwards ſurmounting thoſe juſt reſentments which he might well have entertained againſt the Emperour who had ſo Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly deprived him of his Dutchy, he nevertheleſs followed him in thoſe Wars which he made in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> whereupon all occaſions he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him very ſignal Services: and it is reported that he himſelf took the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Eagle in the Famous Battle againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> who had declared for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Rodolph</hi> of <hi>Suabia,</hi> when Victory beginning to declare herſelf for that Prince, he raviſhed it from him, together with his Life, by giving him a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound with the very Cornet which he had newly taken: And afterwards when the Emperor took the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, he was the firſt man that poſſeſſed himſelf of the breach and thereby Entred the Town. They further add, that after this falling into a moſt violent diſtemper which reduced him to the utmoſt Extremity of Danger, he made a Vow to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an Expedition to the Holy Land, as not long after did many Princes and Biſhops according to the Devotion ſo much in Vogue at that time, and that God Almighty was pleaſed to manifeſt that this Vow was acceptable to him by reſtoring him to his Health beyond all Expectation, and without the application of any of the uſual Remedies. Be it how it will, neither this Vow nor this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, nor this entring the breach at <hi>Rome</hi> are ſuch matters as have any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foundation in the Hiſtorians who were his Contemporaries; but this is moſt certain, that, whether it were that he was ſenſibly touched with the extraordinary Merit of this Prince, and the conſiderable Services which he had received from him, or that he therein gratified the diſpleaſure he had taken againſt <hi>Conrade</hi> who now began to relinquiſh his Intereſts, the Emperor put <hi>Godfrey</hi> into the Poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of the Lower <hi>Lorrain</hi> the Inheritance of his Mother, which he had detained from him Thirteen Years: And that he might yet link him more cloſely than by the meer Obligation of Duty, he was reſolved to have him his Brother in Law, and gave him his Siſter <hi>Adelaida</hi> in Marriage. After which <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſeeing himſelf in a Condition capable of recovering the Earldom of <hi>Verdun</hi> which <hi>Theoderic</hi> the Biſhop and Earl <hi>Albert</hi> at preſent detained from him, that Affair was quickly determined; for the Biſhop and Earl beſieging <hi>Stenay</hi> where <hi>Godfrey</hi> had built a very ſtrong Caſtle, juſt upon the Frontiers
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64918:18"/>of <hi>Verdun,</hi> that from thence he might more eaſily aſſail his Enemies, this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince, though then very much indiſpoſed in Health, yet combated them with ſo much Conduct and Valour, that he relieved the Place; and in a little time after being reinforced with the Troops which <hi>Euſtace</hi> and <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Brothers brought to his aſſiſtance, he obliged them to raiſe their Siege, and in Concluſion they were forced by the Determination of the Biſhop of <hi>Leige</hi> who was made Arbiter of the Difference, to reſtore the Earldom of <hi>Verdun</hi> unto <hi>Godfrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this flouriſhing Poſture were the Affairs of Duke <hi>Godfroy</hi> when the <hi>Cruſade</hi> for the Deliverance of the Holy Land was proclaimed; and he was in the Number of the formoſt to take the Croſs, which he did with that Ardency, that to give Example to other Princes to ſacrifice all to the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſatisfie that importunate Deſire which he had ſo long ſince cheriſhed for this Glorious Conqueſt, he generouſly deſpoiled himſelf of almoſt his whole Inheritance, thereby to enable himſelf to raiſe the more and the better Troops; And for this purpoſe he either morgaged or ſold the Earldom of <hi>Bullen</hi> and <hi>Ardenna</hi> to <hi>Albert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> whoſe Succeſſors are poſſeſſed of it to this very day, <hi>Richerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Verdun,</hi> alſo laid hold of this opportunity to purchaſe the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Stenay</hi> with its Dependancies, and the reſt of the Earldom of Prince <hi>Baldwin</hi> upon whom his Brother <hi>Godfrey</hi> had lately beſtowed it. Inſomuch that by a pretty odd adventure the ſecular Princes impoveriſhed themſelves to ſerve Chriſt Jeſus, and the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> inriched themſelves with the Spoils of theſe Temporal Princes, whoſe Examples ought rather to have incited them to the like Devotion; but they choſe rather to make uſe of that Money, which like them they ſhould have employed to ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Work as the Deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre, to advance their preſent Fortunes, which they ſaw theſe Princes ſo generouſly abandon for the Love of God. But if Hiſtory ought to praiſe the Generoſity of ſuch as ſold their Inheritances upon this Glorious Occalion, yet it has no Authority to condemn the Intentions of thoſe who purchaſed them; Since their Deſign was for the better Accommodation of thoſe Churches of which they were the Paſtors and the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> by theſe ways having put himſelf into a Capacity to raiſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and furniſh an Equipage, was in a ſhort time accompanied with a great Number of ſuch as had taken upon them the Croſs, beſides many Princes and Gentlemen his Friends who ſerved as Volunteers. But the fair Reputation which he had acquired throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> and thoſe admirable Qualities for which he was ſo juſtly valued, brought him in far greater Numbers than his Pay; for Military Men came ſlocking to him from all parts, eſpecially the Eaſtern parts of <hi>France,</hi> the Low Countries, the two <hi>Lorains</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> every one paſſionately coveting to ſerve in this Expedition under his auſpicious Conduct. One ſhall rarely meet in Hiſtory any who ever exceeded this brave Prince either in thoſe obliging Charms which attract mens Hearts, or were more able to manage that abſolute Empire over thoſe Spirits which had ſo voluntarily ſubmitted to them: nor did he ſtand in need of any other Authority to govern them than what he was obliged to for his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and thoſe admirable Graces, whith which Nature had even to Proſuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned him. He was in the Vigor and the very Flower of his Age, having lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty ſive years, his Complexion was Sanguine his Temper Robuſt, and yet ſuch as ſhewed the freſh Sweetneſs and Beauty of Youth in his mature and many Age: his Shape was admirable, his Body ſtraight, and his Stature though ſomething advanced above the common, yet carried a Proportion in all parts ſo regular, as made him only appear ſo tall as to approach to the pitch of Heroick; his Port was extream Majeſtick, his Behaviour grave and ſerious; his Colour delicate and lively, his Cheeks wore the Livery of Vermilion, and his Eyes ſiery and ſparkling, but withal ſweet and attracting, the turn of his face was moſt perfectly exact, his Hair light and fair, his Speech ſweet, and the Sound of his Voice admirably pleaſing; and with all theſe Ornaments of Nature, he had a Demeanor ſo charming and modeſt, that one who accompanied him in this Expedition to the Holy Land aſſures us, that his Converſation ſeemed to have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64918:19"/>more of the meekneſs of a Recluſe than the fierceneſs of a Soldier; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which upon the approach of an Enemy, when he was going to the Combat, he ſeemed in an inſtant metamorphoſed into another quite different Perſon; he looked like a generous Lyon, ſo much Reſolution, Heat, and Fierceneſs appeared in his Eyes, his Voice, his Geſtures and his Gate; and by how much greater the Danger was, ſo much was his Courage redoubled, that it had not the leaſt acquaintance with Fear; and that Soul which Nature had planted in ſo fair a Body was animated with that prodigious force, that there are few examples that can come in competition with him; for neither Caſque, nor Curiaſs, nor Shield where he beſtowed his mighty Blows were any proof againſt his Invincible Arm, or could defend thoſe who wore them from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death: and beſides all this, he was a perfect Maſter at all ſorts of Weapons, and intimately acquainted with every ſecret of the military Art, inſomuch that even Envy it ſelf muſt be conſtrained to give place to the Judgement of the whole Earth, it being impoſſible to diſpute theſe advantages with him, which yet were more marvellous in him who poſſeſſed them, in that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Vertues of a mighty Mind; for it is moſt unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably true, that no Perſon ever better adjuſted the Exerciſes of a military Imploy, with thoſe of an honeſt man and an admirable Chriſtian; He was kind, affable, reſpectful affectionate, tender, and a moſt excellent Friend; he would careſs the meaneſt Souldiers, and comfort them in their Hardſhips with the care and kindneſs of a Father; he was firm and immoveable in his Reſolves, and one who ever kept his Word Inviolable, a great Lover of Juſtice, never failing to render to every Perſon according to his Merits; he was obliging, liberal and magnificent in every thing except what related to his own Perſon, which he neglected in ſuch a manner as was well enough becoming the Perſon of a Souldier, though a Prince, and which rather ſhewed a generous diſdain of Pride and Luxury, than any Inclinations to what was mean or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. He was moſt curiouſly diligent in matters of the greateſt moment, and eſpecially how he might beſt pleaſe Almighty God, to whom by a kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in a man of the Sword, he had the greateſt and moſt conſtant care to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himſelf by the Exerciſes of Devotion, even amidſt the greateſt croud of his moſt Important Affairs, and particularly by an Aſſiduity in his daily making moſt fervent Prayers to the Divine Omnipotence. And his Piety was ſo far from diminiſhing his Native Vigor, that it added new Forces to it, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his underſtanding in ſuch an extraordinary Meaſure, as inabled him to act even beyond admiration both as a Captain and a Souldier.</p>
                  <p>Being ſuch as I have endeavoured to repreſent him from the Diſcription of the Hiſtorians his Contemporaries, or ſuch as lived neareſt to thoſe times, it will now be no matter of aſtoniſhment, that the greateſt Number of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themſelves to this Holy War, came to offer their Service to this gallant man, or if at that inſtant he uſed a certain politick Dexterity whereupon the Succeſs of the Enterprize ſeemed in ſo great a meaſure to depend. For <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit particularly having addreſſed himſelf to him, this Prince imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceiving he ſhould be clogged by having this multitude of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable People upon his hands who blindly followed the Hermit, he concluded that to prevent the diſorders which they might occaſion in his Army, where they were more likely to deſtroy him by Famine than help him by the Sword, he contrived to ſend thoſe People before under the Conduct of their own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, who without ſcruple preſently accepted of the Command; and indeed he thought he ſhould have a Sovereign Power over thoſe Perſon who were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to render him ſuch Extraordinary Honours, even to down-right Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo prepoſſeſſed were they with the opinion of his Sanctity, and as it were charmed with his very looks and enchanted with his words. And certainly, all his actions and the manner of his living, were wonderful proper to draw the applauſe and admiration of the Populace, who ſuffer themſelves eaſily to be affected with outward appearances, eſpecially ſuch as are odd and ſurprizing; for his under Garment was of ſimple Woolen without any dye or colour, with a great Hood the point whereof reached down to his very heels, and over all a Hermits Mantle about his Neck which came to his knees: he went
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64918:19"/>barefooted; his abſtinence was extraordinary, he never eat either Bread or Fleſh, but contented himſelf with Lentils, Fiſh, and a very little Wine, with which he ſuſtained himſelf in the greateſt Fatigues: he never kept any Money, but diſpoſed of thoſe vaſt Summs which were beſtowed upon him, by diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them among the poorer ſort of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> or employed them to maintain the Souldiers, or ſuch Perſons as by his preaching were reclaimed from their vicious courſes, and to marry ſuch young women as by reaſon of their Poverty had taken up the Infamous Trade of ſinning: He compoſed all differences with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Authority, and made Peace where-ever he came; and, in ſhort, he did ſo many good things and gained ſo high a Reputation, that ſeveral witneſſes of admirable Credit, who ſaw him preach the <hi>Cruſade</hi> in France do aver, that the people followed him as if he had been a man ſent from Heaven, and treated him with more Honour and Reverence than any of their Prelates, and that never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man paſſed more generally for a Saint or for a Prophet: that whatever he either ſaid or did, was received as an immediate Command from Heaven, and that the Common People who canonized him for a Living Saint, went ſo far, as to get the very hairs of his Mule, which they laid up as Reliques; thus it is, that after theſe feeble Spirits have according to their way made a Saint of a man upon whom they dote, there is no ſort of Illuſion, Caprice, diſorder or abuſe which they will not miſtake for a Divine Inſpiration, nor any thing tho never ſo fantaſtical or extravagant which they will not be ready to precipitate themſelves into.</p>
                  <p>In reality I cannot think that <hi>Peter</hi> did in the leaſt contribute to this Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blind and injudicious Populace, but on the other hand I cannot believe, that he was at all afflicted to ſee himſelf followed by ſuch Multitudes of People which he thought were intirely at his Devotion, and of whom he perſwaded himſelf he ſhould alwaies be able to retain the Command. And that being a Gentleman who before his retirement had born Arms, the deſire of Glory and ſome little remainders of the Spirit of a Souldier which ſtill dwelt about his heart, might give him no ſort of Repugnance to ſee himſelf at the head of a great Army; and the Nature of the War which was to be undertaken, might eaſily induce him to believe, that he might lawfully undertake ſuch a military Command without affronting his Orders of Prieſthood, or embracing the World which he had renounced. But it was not long before he found by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experience, that he who tranſgreſſeth the Bounds of his Profeſſion, does not proſper long; for he muſt needs want the Bleſſing of God, whoſe pleaſure is that all perſons ſhould keep their Order and Station in the World, and not dare to undertake the Charge or Function which belongs not to them. All this time Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> whoſe principal aim was to diſincumber himſelf of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Rabble who from all parts were rolled together, and which he was in no ſort of Condition to accommodate with ſubſiſtence, was not in the leaſt averſe to follow the inclinations of <hi>Peter;</hi> and therefore he declared him Captain General of this firſt Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> which was ordered to advance firſt towards <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Hermit who would needs imitate the Duke, that he might avoid Confuſion divided his Troops into two Bodies; the firſt, which was compoſed of about the third part of his foot, he put under the Command of a French Gentleman, one of his friends, whoſe name was <hi>Gautier,</hi> a very brave man and a good Captain, but who had no other Fortune beſides his Sword, and who for that reaſon was uſually called Captain <hi>Have-little,</hi> or <hi>Monyleſs.</hi> This Gentleman who had no more than eight Horſemen to guard ſuch a numerous Infantry, began his March the eighteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> and after having with a great deal of trouble paſſed through <hi>Germany</hi> all along the <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> he entered into <hi>Hungary;</hi> that Country was then governed by King <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman,</hi> the youngeſt Son of King <hi>Bela,</hi> whoſe Grandfather was Uncle to St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Son of <hi>Geiza,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> This Prince very frankly permitted them the Liberty of paſſage, they paying for what they had; but this could not prevent the <hi>Hungarians</hi> from very ill treating this ſtragling People: for being arrived upon the Frontier of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> where they were refuſed the accommodations of Proviſions, the Troops were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to live at diſcretion, to plunder the Country and take what they could find for their ſubſiſtence; this ſo incenſed the Inhabitants of thoſe Countries, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64918:20"/>they preſently took Arms, and aſſembling to the number of one hundred forty thouſand men, they fell upon the <hi>Cruſades</hi> ſo briskly, that they had much to do, in great Confuſion, to ſave themſelves among the Woods, after having left a great part of their Companions to the mercy of the Enemies; and <hi>Gautier</hi> with the remainder were in no ſmall danger of periſhing, being for eight days conſtrained to indure the utmoſt Extremities in paſſing through thoſe vaſt and deſolate Forreſts, till in concluſion, arriving at a great Town in <hi>Myſia,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> compaſſionating their Miſeries, did not only ſupply them with plenty of Proviſions, but furniſhed them with able Guides, who carried them the beſt way towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Emperor diſpoſed them in an Encampment to attend the reſt of the Army, which was conducted by <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the Voyage of the poor Hermite was yet more Unfortunate than that of his Precurſor: He had about forty thouſand Foot indifferently well armed, and a good number of Horſe, of whom the Principal were <hi>Renard</hi> of <hi>Breis, Gautier de Breteuil, Foucher</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Godſrey Burel</hi> of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> beſides an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of unneceſſary People, Women, Old Men and Children, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Army, ſome on Foot, and ſome in Carriages. But in truth he now quickly found how great a difference there was between Preaching up the Croſs to an unarmed Audience who run to hear the Novelty, and the Conducting according to the regular Diſcipline of War, and Commanding thoſe who now had Swords in their Hands. For as he Marched through <hi>Hungary,</hi> King <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman</hi> having granted him free Paſſage, provided his People committed no Diſorders, he undertook to ſignalize himſelf with an Action which neither comported with his being a Hermite, nor a Chriſtian, and which both the Laws of Honour and of Prudence might juſtly have prohibited him to do: For under pretence of Revenging the Injury which ſome Souldiers of the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had received at <hi>Malleville,</hi> a good Town upon the Frontier of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> he attaqued the Place by Force, and contrary to his Faith given to <hi>Carloman,</hi> he took it by Storm, putting to the Sword above four thouſand <hi>Hungarians;</hi> after which Action he retained no manner of Authority, nor was in any ſort maſter of thoſe People: For whether they thought themſelves by the Example of their General, Authoriſed to take the Liberty of meaſuring out their own Revenge, or whether it were the deſire of Booty, the Pleaſure of which they now began to taſt in the Saccage of this miſerable Town; or whether ſeeing the Hermite in a Condition ſo different from that wherein they had Reverenced him as a Saint, they retained nothing of the former Idea of him, and they neither conſidered him as <hi>Peter,</hi> nor as the General of the Army, altho he affected both the one and the other. However it were, it is certain, that there was no manner of Exceſs, no ſort of Crimes, Perſidiouſneſs, Cruelty, Robberies, Murder, Fire, or any kind of Violence, which theſe brutiſh Dreggs of the People of <hi>France, Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> did not commit; they neither knew Diſcipline, or any fear of God or Man; but notwithſtanding all that the Hermite could with his utmoſt Power do, to oppoſe them, they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelves to the Commiſſion of the moſt horrible Ravages, all along their March through <hi>Hungary</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Bulgaria.</hi> But as one of the Writers of that time obſerves, who doth not diſſemble the Truth, as doth <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who writ a long time after; When once a Body, otherwiſe of an ill Compoſure, comes to have a weak and languiſhing Head, it becomes every day worſe and worſe, and cannot in Concluſion, poſſibly avoid a neceſſary Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And ſo it happened here, for the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> juſtly exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt theſe perſidious Wretches, took all Occaſions to fall upon them; and finding them in a diſorderly March, they ſlew above ten thouſand of them upon the place, took all their Baggage and their Proviſions, their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the old Men who could not ſlye, together with two thouſand Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, amongſt which were thoſe which carried the Treaſure of <hi>Peter</hi> the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite. Nor was it without great Difficulty that he rallied the reſt of his Troops, who ſaved themſelves in the Woods and Mountains, and that in Concluſion, in extreme want of all things, the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he joyned <hi>Gautier</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyleſs,</hi> who waited for his coming, little expecting to ſind him reduced to ſuch a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64918:20"/>piteous Condition as he himſelf was in, being obliged to live upon the Charity and Alms of the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe ill Examples being extremely Contagious, it happened that in a little time after two other Armies of theſe counterfeit <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who abuſed ſo Religious an Enterpriſe, following the ſame Methods, and rather ſurpaſſing the Diſorders of the firſt, did alſo by the moſt juſt Judgment of God, periſh in a moſt deplorable manner. For a <hi>German</hi> Prieſt of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> one <hi>Godeſcale,</hi> who had conferred with <hi>Peter</hi> in his Travails, was reſolved to imitate him; and therefore he did with ſuch vehemency preach up the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that he aſſembled about fifteen thouſand Soldiers, <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> at the Head of whom he put himſelf, and very peaceably, and with out any Diſorder, paying exactly for whatever they took, he marched as far as <hi>Hungary:</hi> But finding there an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Plenty of all things, the Year having been the moſt Fruitful that had been known, they fell to Debauchery; ſo that being almoſt continually drunk, there was no ſort of Inſolence, injaſtice, or Cruelty, which with a horrible Brutali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they did not commit againſt thoſe who had ſo courteouſly Entertained them. Whereupon all <hi>Hungary</hi> by the Command of the King was immediately in Arms, in order to exterminate theſe perfidious Villains, ſo that beſieging them in their Camp, they were, in ſhort, compelled to ſurrender their Arms and themſelves to Diſcretion to the Officers of the King, they giving them an aſſurance of their Lives; but the <hi>Hungarians</hi> furiouſly Incenſed againſt them, thinking it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawful to revenge Perſidiouſneſs by Treachery, no ſooner ſaw them diſarmed but they fell upon them and put them all to the Sword, except a very few who eſcaped the Maſſacre to carry the woful News into their own Country to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who yet by their Misfortune grew never the Wiſer or more Conſiderate.</p>
                  <p>For in the beginning of the Summer of this ſame Year, a prodigious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People, gathered from divers parts of <hi>France, England,</hi> the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and that part of <hi>Germany</hi> which lyes upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them an infinite of Women and People of the lewdeſt Condition in the World, aſſembled themſelves near <hi>Collen,</hi> where they paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to joyn with Count <hi>Emico,</hi> who attended them with a great number of <hi>Cruſades</hi> of the higher <hi>Germany,</hi> of the ſame diſſolute Complexion with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe People to Signalize their falſe Zeal by covering a moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Action with the ſpecious pretence of Piety, moſt inhumanly Maſſacred all the Jews whom they found at <hi>Collen</hi> and <hi>Mayence,</hi> where they forced the Arch-Biſhops Palace, where <hi>Rothard</hi> the Archbiſhop had ſecured a hundred of theſe poor Creatures, as in a Sanctuary. But it proved no Protection againſt the Fury of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who Butchered them in a moſt ſavage manner, cutting their Throats like Sheep, ſparing neither the Women for their Sex, nor the Children for their innocent Age, nor indeed was there any Sanctuary to be found againſt this horrible Barbariſm which was inſpired by Avarice, and promoted by an inſatiable Covetouſneſs of the Riches of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Inſomuch that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them being reduced to the utmoſt Diſpair, choſe rather to repeat the doleful Example of <hi>Saguntum &amp; Capua,</hi> and with their own Hand to commit the bloody Execution; ſo that barricadoing themſelves within their Houſes, the pityleſs Mothers like Furies cut the Throats of their ſucking Babes, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands their Wives and Daughters, and the Fathers their Sons, and the Servants choſe rather to diſpatch each other, than to fall into the Hands of thoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Monſters, who profaned the Character, and rendered the Name of Chriſtian, of which they were unworthy, moſt Infamous and Deteſtable.</p>
                  <p>But it was not long before God Almighty, by the remarkable Vengeance which he executed upon theſe wicked People, manifeſted the Abhorrence which he had of their Crimes, and that he had no Intention to make uſe of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in reconquering the Inheritance of his Son, by the profane Hands of thoſe who had declared themſelves his Enemies, by ſuch Impieties, as even the Infidels themſelves would have bluſhed to commit. For this huge Army of Bedlams, which conſiſted of above two hundred thouſand Men, of whom there were not above three thouſand Horſe, laying Siege to <hi>Mesbourg,</hi> a ſtrong place upon the <hi>Danubius</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where they were denyed Paſſage, and when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64918:21"/>they were juſt upon the point of gaining it, was in an inſtant ſtruck with ſuch a Pannick Fear, that they fled with ſo much Precipitation, Blindneſs, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and all periſhed there except a very few of the Horſe, who being well mounted ſaved themſelves by Flight: For the greateſt part of them were Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered whileſt they indeavoured to paſs the <hi>Moraſs</hi> with which the Town is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed, others were ſlain by the Garriſon, who upon this occaſion ſallying out, followed them with Death cloſely at the Heels; many were cut off by the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants who ran from all parts to take Vengeance of theſe Robbers, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them were drowned, whileſt indeavouring to paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> they tumbled headlong one upon another, ſo that the Shoar of that great River was for ſome time covered with their dead Bodies; inſomuch that this prodigious multitude of diſtracted People, who pretended with impunity to commit the moſt execrable Crimes in the World, cauſing a Shee-Goat to be worſhipped, which was carried at the Head of the Army as their conducting Divinity, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in a moment, by a terrible Blow of the Divine Juſtice, which would not indure to be affronted by their pretended Piety, and making Religion only a Cover for thoſe abominable Wickedneſſes wherewith they daily diſhonored God.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1096</label> But to proceed, the Army of <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite did not meet with a Fortune much more advantageous: It was now become very numerous by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of an infinite number of <hi>Lombards, Genoeſe, Piemontanes,</hi> and other People of <hi>Italy,</hi> who having taken upon them the Croſs with the earlieſt, even preſently after the Council of <hi>Clermont,</hi> came in ſeveral Troops by themſelves without any Leaders, and being joyned with thoſe Forces of <hi>Gautier</hi> near <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> they were commanded there to attend the Arrival of the Hermite by the Emperors Order, who now began to entertain ſome ſuſpicious Jealouſies of this great Army of <hi>Franks,</hi> who were to be followed by others as numerous as they. So ſoon as <hi>Peter</hi> was arrived, the Emperor who had an extream deſire to ſee him, ſent for him to the Palace, where the Hermite, who by the Voyage he had made into the <hi>Levant,</hi> was well skilled in the Language, and as Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent an Orator as a great Captain, made him a Diſcourſe in publick upon the Subject of this Expedition and the <hi>Holy War,</hi> of the Forces, and Qualities of the Princes which were expected; with which the Emperor appeared ſo well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he made the Hermite very fair Preſents, and beſtowed upon him a round Sum of Money to buy Proviſions for his Troops. After which he ſent him back to the Camp, Exhorting him by no means to precipitate this great Affair, and eſpecially not to attempt the paſſing of the <hi>Straits</hi> till the Arrival of the Princes; nor to expoſe his harraſſed Troops againſt thoſe of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which were far ſtronger than his, and againſt which his tired and feeble Men would be able to make no tolerable Reſiſtance. The truth is, the greateſt part of our Hiſtorians repreſent this Prince as the moſt perfidious and diſloyal of Mankind; one who under the fine appearance of a feigned Friendſhip, covered that horrible Treaſon which he had contrived againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> which was by a thouſand unworthy Artifices to bring them to Deſtruction, as well as by the Arms of the Turkiſh Infidels; on the other ſide, the Greek Writers, when they mention this Emperor and this War, ſpeak nothing like it; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Anna</hi> his Daughter, who hath written the Hiſtory of her Father, in a Stile Florid and Beautiful, after the Genius of her Sex, in her <hi>Alexiada,</hi> paints him directly contrary, and hath dreſſed him up like a Hero, a Wiſe and Politick Prince, who upon this Occurrence performed the moſt admirable things in the World. But to deal ſincerely and without Prejudice, the beſt way in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is to avoid both theſe Extreams, to the end thereby, if poſſible, to find out Truth in the middle Way.</p>
                  <p>But this is moſt certain, that this <hi>Alexis Comnenius</hi> was no other than an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of the Empire of his Maſter and his Benefactor, who had given him the Command of General of all his Forces: He was a Prince who was dexterouſly Cunning, and a witty Diſſembler, Covetous and Cruel, and one who eaſily made the Laws of Honour, Conſcience, and Juſtice, comply with humane Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and whatever ſeemed to be his preſent Intereſt: And therefore it is moſt probable, in my Judgment, that he having ſo earneſtly requeſted of the Pope,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64918:21"/>to procure him the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Latins</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were now become Maſters of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and threatned the Imperial City, that it was his real Deſign to receive the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and to joyn his Forces with them, to Defeat thoſe incroaching and dangerous Neighbours, and to recover thoſe Provinces which his Predeceſſors had loſt; and that for this Reaſon he adviſed <hi>Peter,</hi> by no means to paſs into <hi>Aſia</hi> with thoſe raw and undiſciplined Men. But in making my Obſervations out of ſome of our own Authors, I find there were two things which made him change this Opinion, and take Meaſures quite different from his former Reſolution. The firſt was that great, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, prodigious Number of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and thoſe valiant Men who were expected under the Conduct of the Princes of <hi>France,</hi> of whoſe Courage and Ambition he was not too well aſſured. For in truth, the Pope believing it would be joyful and welcome News to him, had given him an account by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſome time after the Council of <hi>Clermont,</hi> that in a ſmall time he ſhould have on Foot an Army of three hundred thouſand <hi>Cruſades,</hi> under the Command of thoſe brave Princes, whoſe Names and Qualities he therein recounted to him, and that by the Noiſe which this Deſign made throughout all the <hi>Weſt,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Number would be augmented every day. But that which gave him the greateſt Diſturbance of all, was, that ſome time after he received Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the famous <hi>Bohemond,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert Guiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> who even in <hi>Greece</hi> had made War with him ſo much to his Glory and Advantage, was to make one of the Party; then immediately the Devil of State-Jealouſy entred into, and poſſeſſed his Soul, that this brave <hi>Norman</hi> Prince might poſſibly have preingaged all thoſe other Princes, and formed ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful League amongſt them, under the Colour of a War againſt the Infidels, to turn all thoſe Arms againſt himſelf, and following the Traces of his Fathers Deſign, indeavour to deprive him of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, was the inſupportable Inſolence of this Army of Peaſants and Vagabonds, which <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite and <hi>Gautier,</hi> after a miſerable Faſhion ſeemed to Command, who indeed were under no manner of Obedience; the Emperor <hi>Alexis</hi> had given them Liberty to Encamp without the Suburbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to Traffique with his People for all kind of Neceſſaries at the Price Currant; but theſe Brutes, who laughed at the Orders of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, took what Liberty they thought fit, and committed the very ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which had been ſo fatal to them before in <hi>Hungary,</hi> for in five days ſpace they made ſuch a Deſolation in the Suburbs of that City, and the places adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that even the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> themſelves could not have done more; they Plundered all the beautiful Houſes of Pleaſure, and the magnificent Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were without the City, and afterwards burnt them; they Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Robbed the Churches, ſtripping them even of the very Coverings of the Lead, which they ſold to the <hi>Greeks:</hi> Theſe fearful and exceſſive Brutalities, did ſo fortify the Jealouſies of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſo exaſperated him againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> that without conſidering that theſe were only the Scum and Sink of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, as he very well underſtood himſelf; he reſolved to do all that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could, utterly to deſtroy them, and yet ſo far to diſſemble with the Princes, as to draw to himſelf all the Advantages he could from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And therefore, whereas formerly he had Counſelled the Hermite to expect the coming up of the reſt of the Forces, and not to expoſe himſelf with thoſe pitiful Troops, he was now for having him immediately to paſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Straits</hi> through <hi>Bithynia:</hi> This they did, all the way commiting the ſame Diſorder, till they came to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> Plundering, Ravaging, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating the Lands, Houſes, and the Churches of the Chriſtians, againſt whom theſe Libertines ſeemed to make that War, which they had vowed to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infidels, neither the Fear of God, nor the Authority of their Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite General being in the leaſt available to ſtop the Torrent of their Fury.</p>
                  <p>But God Almighty to vindicate the Honor of his Juſtice, in a little time took Vengeance on them, and puniſhed their innumerable Crimes, making to periſh by the Hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> thoſe who had ſo unworthily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned the Croſs, which they had undertaken againſt them: For as Peace and Unity cannot long be preſerved among wicked Men who are always reſtleſs, ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64918:22"/>here it happened: For the Spirit of Diviſion falling upon this unruly Army; the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Humor they were not able to ſupport, and who in reality treated them with more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance and Contempt, and as our own Hiſtorians affirm, in terms far worſe than I relate it, therefore abandoning <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite, they choſe for their Captain one <hi>Renaud;</hi> as appeared by his future Conduct, one of the looſeſt and moſt Wicked of the whole Crew. He being imployed in the mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try near <hi>Nice,</hi> took there firſt a ſmall Village, and preſently after ſeized on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother large Town, which he found forſaken of all its Inhabitants, but replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with abundance of all ſorts of Proviſions: And whileſt he there amuſed himſelf and his whole Army with Feaſting and Jollity, the young <hi>Soliman</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of <hi>Nice,</hi> who upon the Alarm of the coming of the Weſtern Chriſtians, had raiſed a formidable Army, compoſed of the moſt valiant <hi>Turks</hi> of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> came to Inveſt him; the better part of his Army being before defeated upon <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> day, whileſt going out under his ill Conduct, to ſurprize the Sultan by an Ambuſcade, they themſelves fell into an Ambuſcade of the <hi>Turks,</hi> by whom they were ſurprized. After this the Siege was of no long continuance, for the Leud and Cowardly <hi>Renaud,</hi> unable to indure the Extremity of Thirſt, to which <hi>Soliman</hi> had reduced the Place by cutting off their Water, pretending to go out upon a Parly, went and rendered himſelf with his Followers to the Enemies, and turned <hi>Turk;</hi> after which the others were forced to Surrender themſelves upon Diſcretion: And that which is the moſt deplorable, and remarkable piece of Divine Vengeance, is, that thoſe Perſons who had by their enormous Crimes, rendred themſelves unworthy of the Grace of God, generally imitating their wicked Captain, renounced their Faith to ſave their Lives; There were divers nevertheleſs upon whom God had ſo much Compaſſion, who abhorring that deteſtable Apoſtacy, choſe to obliterate the ſhame of their former wicked Lives, by a glorious Death, to which they generouſly offered themſelves for the ſake of Chriſt Jeſus; ſome of which loſt their Lives by divers kinds of Torments, and others by a lingring Martyrdom, changing their Freedom into a moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Slavery.</p>
                  <p>The lot of the <hi>French,</hi> from whom the other Nations had ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was not much more Fortunate; they were Incamped near <hi>Helenopolis</hi> and <hi>Cybotus,</hi> which our Writers call <hi>Civitot,</hi> which are two Villages ſituate in the Gulph of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and neareſt to the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> from whence they ſent out great Parties to deſtroy the Forrage about that City. But the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among them were ſtill as great, or greater than before, ſo that <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable longer to indure their Inſolence, abandoned them, leaving the whole Command to <hi>Gautier,</hi> and retiring to <hi>Constantinople</hi> under pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Proviſion for the Army. <hi>Soliman</hi> who was a great Captain, and kept good Intelligence, and who knew how to uſe his Victory, reſolved now to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a ſecond, by attacking theſe People who had neither Diſcipline, Order, nor Head, whom therefore he purpoſed to ſurprize in their Camp. But by a ſtrange Adventure it happened that theſe who had juſt now received the ſad News of the Defeat of their Companions, forced their Captains, contrary to their Inclinations, to draw out and March towards <hi>Nice,</hi> with a Reſolution to fall unexpectedly upon <hi>Soliman,</hi> and ſurprize him whileſt he was injoying the Pleaſures of his laſt Victory; they therefore decamped with twenty five thouſand Men, divided into ſix Batallions under ſo many Standards, and with about five hundred Curiaſſiers on Horſeback: There lay between the <hi>French</hi> Camp and the City of <hi>Nice</hi> ſeveral high Mountains covered with Woods, from whence there is a Deſcent into a fair Plain, where this great Town is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. As the <hi>French</hi> paſſed theſe Mountains and Forreſts in Diſorder, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Cuſtome, making a mighty Noiſe, <hi>Soliman</hi> who was advanced ſo far on his way from <hi>Nice,</hi> with a deſign to attack them, little imagining they were coming to meet him, being thereof informed by his Scouts, who without being diſcovered by the <hi>French,</hi> gave him this Advertiſement; he immediately retreated into the Plain, where he drew up his Army in Battalia. The <hi>French</hi> who were ſtrangely diſappointed to find thoſe ſo near them, and in ſo good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom they thought to have ſurprized, nevertheleſs ſtood not to conſider
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64918:22"/>whether they ſhould fight or not, but gave a furious Charge with two of their Batallions and their little body of Cavalry, upon the main Body of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but they who were far more in number than the <hi>French,</hi> extending their Wings to the right and left, encompaſſed them, and cutting off the Reſerves which were to follow, they poured in a ſhower of Arrows from all parts upon them, and charged them with ſo much Fury, that not being able to rally, they were in concluſion cut all in pieces.</p>
                  <p>The brave <hi>Gautier Hievelittle</hi> who combated that day like a man, who ſince he could not hope to conquer, was reſolved to fall nobly, being ſhot through with ſeven Arrows dyed; <hi>Renaud</hi> of <hi>Breis</hi> and <hi>Foucher</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> alſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with all the Cavalry, ſelling their lives to the Infidels at an exceſſive rate: <hi>Gautier</hi> of <hi>Breteuil</hi> and <hi>Godfrey Burel</hi> Colonel of Foot, who was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that contrary to the Opinion of the wiſer Captains drew the Army into this miſfortune, ſaved themſelves among the Rocks and Buſhes, retiring to thoſe who were not yet drawn out from the Woods, but they ſeeing all loſt dreamt of nothing but how to ſave themſelves. But the <hi>Turks</hi> who followed them cloſe at the Heels, purſued them with ſo much heat that they entred their Camp with the Fugitives, where they made a moſt horrible ſlaughter among the Women, Children, Sick People, Old Men, Prieſts and Monks which were leſt there with a very ſlender Guard of Soldiers, and were generally either aſleep, or, which was worſe, making debauches: thoſe who were able to ſave themſelves from ſuch a woſul Maſſacre, retired ſome of them into the Mountains where they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrably periſhed; others to <hi>Civitot,</hi> where the Town being preſently after taken by the <hi>Turks</hi> they were all made ſlaves. Inſomuch that of this innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Multitude of <hi>Cruſades</hi> of ſo many different Nations which <hi>Peter</hi> had led as far as the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> there did not remain above three thouſand men, who ſaved themſelves in a little Ruinous Village upon the <hi>Propontis,</hi> which they defended for ſeveral days by meer deſperation, and from whence they were at length drawn off and brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the Emperors Fleet, diſarmed and almoſt naked, the Emperour being ſcarce able to diſſemble his malicious joy for this defeat of the Chriſtians. This was the Event of the Expedition of the Hermit, who after he had done ſuch notable things when he acted in his own Sphere as a Hermit, a Prieſt, and a Preacher of the Croſs to excite-men to this Holy War, came off ſo poorly, when he acted contrary to his Profeſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed his Pilgrims Staff for a Sword, appearing at the head of an Army with a Helmet upon his gray head, and under that the Monks Cowl, which did ſo ill accord with the Equipage and the Quality of a General. This may inform us in a Leſſon which cannot be too often repeated, That as the natural frame of the Univerſe is conſerved by the Different actions of the Elements, which whilſt they act in their proper places produces the moſt admirable Concord, but ruin and confound all when once they depart from thoſe regular Movements; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the civil World ſubſiſt longer than whileſt the different functions of men retain a conformity ſuitable to their Condition, and that generally all is ſpoiled when theſe are confounded.</p>
                  <p>But the unfortunate beginning of this Holy War, was but only a kind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe corrupted Humors, which otherwiſe might have indangered the ſounder Body of the whole Chriſtian Army; and which enabled it to act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a far different manner, than it could poſſibly have done with the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe irregular People. For in the ſame time whileſt theſe matters paſſed in this manner in <hi>Aſia</hi> in the Months of <hi>Auguſt, September</hi> and <hi>October, Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> began his, March the fifteenth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> with a puiſſant Army of ten thouſand Horſe, and ſeventy thouſand foot, well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and for the moſt part choſen out of the Noble Families of <hi>France,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1196</label> rain</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſeemed tranſported with joy to ſight under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch a noble General. He had alſo in his Company his Brother <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and among other Princes and Lords of the firſt Quality <hi>Baldwin de Bourg</hi> his Couſin Earl of <hi>Retel,</hi> the Counts <hi>Hugh de St. Paul,</hi> with his Son <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelram, Renald de Toul</hi> with <hi>Peter</hi> his Brother, <hi>Baldwin de Mons</hi> Couſin to the Earl of <hi>Flanders, Garnier de Grezi</hi> Kinſman to Duke <hi>Godfrey, Conon de Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigu, Dudon de Conty, Henry</hi> and <hi>Godfrey de Haſche;</hi> all which were ſollowed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64918:23"/>by the Choiceſt Gentlemen and the brave Spirits of their Eſtates. When this Army was arrived in <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> it was obliged to halt upon the Frontier of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to treat with King <hi>Carloman</hi> concerning their paſſage: For in Truth he had ſufficient reaſon to be diſtruſtful of this Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> after the horrible injuries which he had received from thoſe of <hi>Peter, Godeſcalc</hi> and <hi>Emico.</hi> The Treaty was however quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the open and plain dealing between the King and the Duke, who had an Interview upon a certain Bridge. The King demanded as Hoſtages Prince <hi>Baldwin</hi> and the Princeſs his Lady; and coaſting all along with the Army of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> ordered the Magazines to furniſh them with Proviſions at a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable price, till ſuch time as the greateſt part of the Troops were paſſed over the <hi>Savus,</hi> where he returned the Hoſtages with a thouſand Proteſtations of Amity to the Duke, whoſe Conduct and Fidelity he had in extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. With the ſame order <hi>Godfrey</hi> cauſed his Army to paſs over the vaſt Countries of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> and the Territories of the Greek Emperour, according as he had promiſed his Embaſſadors who were ſent to him by <hi>Alexis,</hi> whileſt he was upon his March, until at length he arrived at <hi>Philipopolis</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> where he received Intelligence of the detention of <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>This young Prince who was Brother to <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France,</hi> had not, to ſpeak Truth, either ſo much Experience, or ſo much Ability as the other Princes of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> who were poſſeſſed of very fair Eſtates; but however he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon admirably well compoſed, full of Honour Vertue and Goodneſs, extream Brave, and of an Humour ſweet and indearing: the advantage which he had by his Illuſtrious Birth, above the reſt gave him a title to a greater Reſpect, and he was therefore treated with ſo much Honour and Duty by all, that though diverſe others had in reality a greater Command and Intereſt in the Army, yet nevertheleſs his Name was more Celebrated among ſtrangers and eſpecially the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Princes which accompanied him in this Voyage were <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerer, with the Noble Troops of Engliſh, Normans and Brittains; <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Chartres</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> whoſe power was ſo great that it was commonly ſaid, that he was owner of more Places and Caſtles then there were days in the year; Prince <hi>Eustace</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> Brother to Duke <hi>Godfrey;</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſold his Eſtate to furniſh the Charges of this War. Theſe Princes who together compoſed a moſt puiſſant and numerous Army, having ſtated their meaſures and conferred a long time at <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Hugh</hi> the great in the preſence of the King his Brother, put themſelves upon their Way in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> and having traverſed <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> and received the Benediction of the Pope whom they found at <hi>Leuca,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo having viſited <hi>Rome</hi> and the Holy Places to implore the Divine Aſſiſtance, the Winter being too far advanced for them commodiouſly to paſs into <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> they were obliged to diſtribute their Army about <hi>Bari, Brindes</hi> and <hi>Otran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> there to attend the coming of the Spring and the conveniency of imbarquing their Forces. But <hi>Hugh</hi> ſuffering himſelf to be tranſported by the heat of his Conrage, and the Impatience natural to Young Perſons, and above all others, thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, was not able to ſupport this delay, but expoſed himſelf too raſhly to the Faith of the Greeks, imbarking at <hi>Bari</hi> to paſs to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> as he did very ſlenderly accompanied, and in a condition in no ſort ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Quality and the Majeſtick Name of <hi>France</hi> which he was to ſuſtain during this War. But the Governour of that place, whether it were that he had ſecret Orders to ſecure ſuch of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> as he could ſurprize, or that he believed he ſhould do his Maſter the Emperor a conſiderable Service by putting into his hands ſo great a Prince, who might ſerve for a Hoſtage to ſecure him againſt the <hi>Latins;</hi> immediately upon his arrival ſeized him, and ſent him under a ſtrong Guard through By-ways to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where the Emperor detained him Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> who preſently after this adventure arrived at <hi>Philipopolis</hi> where he received an account of it, ſent immediately to the Emperour to demand the Liberty of this Prince and thoſe who accompanied him, and in the mean time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his Army as far as <hi>Adrianople.</hi> But perceiving by the Anſwer which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64918:23"/>he received from <hi>Alexis</hi> what he was to Expect, he acted like an open Enemy, and for eight days waſting the Country all along as he went he marched directly to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he raiſed ſuch a conſternation, that <hi>Alexis</hi> ſent to him to his Camp to deſire a Peace, making him all the Promiſes of receiving a juſt ſatisfaction. In ſhort, <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſtill advancing encamped two days before Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs within view of this great City, when with joy he received <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great to whom the Emperor had now given his Liberty, and who came to pay his thanks to his Deliverer and Benefactor, accompanied with <hi>Drogon de Neele, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rembaud de Vendeuïle</hi> and <hi>William Viſcount</hi> of <hi>Melun</hi> commonly called the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, either becauſe he was ſo notable an Artiſt in framing of Engines of War, or that according to the mode of Expreſſion in thoſe times, he uſed ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly to hack and hew his Enemies, that neither Cask, Shield nor Curiaſs, was able to reſiſt the Force of his blows. But this Peace by reaſon of the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Alexis</hi> laſted not long, for perceiving that after he had given orders privately to prohibit the furniſhing them with proviſions, the Army began to live at Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had recourſe to Artifice, and deſired <hi>Godfrey</hi> to take up his Quarters in the fair Houſes, Palaces, Hamblets and Villages which lay all along the <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> to the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, pretending the Rigor of the ſeaſon was too extream to permit them to continue in their Camp, but the truth is with a deſign to lock up this great Army in the little ſpace which is between the Strait and the River which diſcharges it ſelf into the Port, that there he might more eaſily deſtroy them. He had alſo a deſign to ſurprize the Duke, inviting him to come to the Palace to confer with him about the War; but finding that the Duke would not be decoyed, and that he did with good reaſon diſtruſt him, he endeavoured again to famiſh the Army, prohibiting the furniſhing them with any kind of proviſions; he alſo attacked them both by Sea and Land, for he commanded out his Cavalry againſt thoſe who were ſent to forrage, and cauſed many Veſſels manned with Archers to fall down the River, who inceſſantly diſcharged upon ſuch of the Soldiers as appeared. But his Enterprize proſpered accordingly, for <hi>Godfrey</hi> with eaſe defeating the <hi>Greek</hi> Cavalry, made himſelf Maſter of the Bridge of <hi>Blakerneſs,</hi> in deſpite of all that the Emperors People endeavoured to do to oppoſe him, and having without danger repaſſed the Main of his Army, who ſet ſire at their parting to the Houſes and Palaces where they had lain, he went and incamped in the plain of <hi>Blakerneſs.</hi> In the night he was attacked by all the Emperors Forces, but he repulſed them immediately, and drive them into the Town though with little loſs, by reaſon that they made more haſt to retire than they had done to aſſail him. After which having for five or ſix days waſted all about <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in revenge of the deteſtable infidelity of the Emperor, <hi>Alexis</hi> was compelled to deſire a new accommodation: He volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered his Son <hi>John Porphirogenitus</hi> for a Hoſtage to oblige the Duke to come to his Palace, there to confer about the Articles of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> who deſired nothing but the means to execute his principal Deſign, and to paſs with ſafety into <hi>Aſia,</hi> accepted the condition; and having ſent his Couſin <hi>Baldwin, du Bourg</hi> and <hi>Conon</hi> Earl of <hi>Mountaigu</hi> to receive the Prince, he made the Army retreat to their former Port upon the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> where leaving <hi>Baldwin</hi> to command them, he with <hi>Hugh</hi> and the other Princes went up the River to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Emperor received them there with much magnificence, and according to the cuſtom obſerved by the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as a ſign of amity and intire confidence, when they are minded to do a ſingular honor to any Prince, he would needs adopt him for his Son. After which the Emperor propoſed the Conditions of the Treaty, which were reduced to theſe two Articles; Firſt <hi>Alexis</hi> promiſed upon his Oath to aid theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with all his Power both by Sea and by Land, that he would joyn his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with theirs and lead them in his own Perſon, that he would with his Fleet continually ſupply the Army with Proviſions, and do no ſort of Injury to thoſe who ſerved in this War. The ſecond was, that theſe Princes ſhould recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ingage to do nothing contrary to his Intereſts; that they ſhould reſtore to him ſuch places of Importance as they ſhould recover in <hi>Aſta,</hi> do homage for others, and take an Oath of fealty to him as his Subjects for ſuch Lands which they ſhould hold of the Emperor. This laſt which was a very nice
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64918:24"/>point was a long time conteſted by the Princes, who thought it would be very diſhonourable to them to declare themſelves Vaſſals of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, but after mature conſideration, that without ſtocking the Authority of their own Sovereigns they might become Feudaries to another lefter Prince, and ſwear fealty to him for ſuch lands as they held of him; and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible their enterprize ſhould ſucceed well if they ſhould have the Emperor always oppoſite to them, they reſolved to give him that which he deſired, and to give him their Oaths and do that Homage, but with this Limitation, That they ſhould be no longer obliged then whileſt he punctually performed his Part of the Agreement. After which the Emperor, who was magnificent even to Profuſion, ſtriving to purchaſe a Reputation of being liberal to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers though at the rates of Avarice and Cruelty, impoveriſhing his Subjects by unſupportable Exactions, loaded theſe Princes with Honours, and made them exceſſive rich Preſents. And for the ſubſiſtence of the Dukes Army, he ordered every week ſo much mony as he deſired to be paid him, which nevertheleſs he was afterards obliged to return by the way of <hi>Spain:</hi> For this Prince who was moſt ſordidly covetous, being Maſter of all the Commodities of his Empire, there was not a Merchant but who was a kind of Cuſtom-houſe Officer to him, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give him an exact account of whatever was either imported or exported throughout his Dominions. Miſerable is the condition of thoſe Subjects who live under ſuch Princes who will allow them no manner of Property in their Goods, or rather, moſt unfortunate are thoſe Princes who in reality have none but Slaves and Beggars for their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Emperor who was informed that the other Princes were upon their March with puiſſant Armies, deſired Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> about the beginning of Lent to paſs with his Army towards <hi>Bithynia</hi> and to encamp near <hi>Calcedon,</hi> alledging that he could no longer ſind ſubſiſtence for his Troops in the place where they lay; but this was in reality only a politick ſtratagem, to avoid the aſſembling ſo near him ſo many Gueſts who were very much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by him; and above all others he was poſſeſſed with an extream appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of <hi>Bohemond</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> who preſently after <hi>Eaſter</hi> arrived with the choiceſt <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> who had made themſelves Maſters of the extream part of <hi>Italy,</hi> by an adventure which becauſe it redounds to the glory of our Nation, I ſhall think it no trouble in a few words to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>

Theſe Pilgrims who were brave men, tall of ſtature, and of a good Mind, had a great deſire to ſignalize their Zeal upon ſo fair an occaſion; having therefore eaſily obtained of <hi>Gaimar</hi> Prince of <hi>Salernum</hi> Horſes and Arms, and the liberty which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make a Sally up on the Enemies, they iſſued out to ſo good purpoſe, and fought with ſo much Conduct and bravery in the view of the whole Town which ran to the Walls to behold them, that having filled the whole Camp of the <hi>Saracens</hi> with confuſion, blood and ſlaughter, and burnt their Engines of War, they obliged them to raiſe their Siege by one of the moſt memorable actions that is extant upon hiſtorical Record, <hi>Gaimar</hi> did what poſſibly he could to ſtay theſe brave men with him, and offered them moſt magnificent recompences for the Service they had done; but they generouſly refuſing aſſured him they expected nothing but the Reward of God Almighty for whoſe Glory they had combated againſt his Enemies of his Holy Name; and that having performed their Vows, they were under undiſpenſible obligations of returning into their own Country. However this Prince willing by ſome way or other, to draw to himſelf ſome of ſo valiant and generous a Nation, requeſted them to take along with them his Ambaſſadours, which being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, the Ambaſſadors carried with them ſome of the moſt delicious Fruits of <hi>Champain, Italy, Pavia</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> and particularly Citrons, Lemons and Oranges, which the Ancients called Golden Apples, none of which grew in <hi>Normandy.</hi> They managed their affairs there with ſo much dexterity that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64918:24"/>many Gentlemen allured with the Pleaſure of thoſe beautiful Fruits, but much more with the Fruits of Glory, which they hoped to gain by making War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> followed the Ambaſſadors.

                  <p>The moſt conſiderable of theſe was a Perſon of Quality, one <hi>Tancred</hi> Lord of <hi>Hauteville,</hi> who of twelve Sons which he had, not at all inferior to their Father in Courage, ſent eleven of them into <hi>Italy.</hi> They were ſo fortunate, that in a little time a fair Occaſion preſented itſelf to them, to eſtabliſh their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in <hi>Italy:</hi> For <hi>Baldwin</hi> Lieutenant to the <hi>Greek</hi> Governor, being ill treated by him, craving Aid of theſe <hi>Normans,</hi> broak out into Terms of Defiance with him.

                  <p>This brave Earl having paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and taken his way by <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Friul,</hi> Marched quite through <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> being forced continually to ſtand upon his Guard to defend himſelf from the ancient <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> a Barbaroas People who then Inhabited that Country, and who never failed upon any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to aſſail him, and lay Ambuſcades for him all the Way till he came to <hi>Duras;</hi> from thence he entred into <hi>Epirus,</hi> and traverſed all <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Thracia,</hi> till he came to a Town upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> within four days March of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having been forced to ſight his Paſſage all the way againſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> which the perfidious <hi>Alexis,</hi> contrary to all his fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Friendſhip, had cauſed to arm againſt him. However for the preſent he diſſembled the Injury, and tho not without a great deal of Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, leaving his Army Encamped near that City, he advanced with a ſmall Train to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there to treat with the Emperor, according to the earneſt Deſires of the Princes who had already paſſed the <hi>Strait,</hi> who now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing more than to come to a Conjunction of their Forces, in order to their entring upon Action. The Emperor after a magnificent Reception, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him alſo to the point of Homage, as the other Princes had agreed: The Earl ſmartly replied, That he would never do it, and that he was not come ſo far as the <hi>Levant</hi> to find a Maſter, nor did he intend to become a Vaſſal to any other beſides <hi>Christ Jeſus:</hi> But that nevertheleſs, if his Imperial Majeſty would joyn his Forces with theirs, and put himſelf at the Head of the Army, he would without trouble acknowledg him for his General, and in that Quality oney him as well as any of the reſt. <hi>Alexis</hi> netled at this Denial, however ſtilled his ill Humor, and amuling the Earl with a pretence of treating with him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the Common Intereſts, the Imperial Troops who were Quartered in <hi>Thracia,</hi> receiving ſecret Orders to that purpoſe, ſell unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in the Night upon his Camp, who believing themſelves in great Security in the Country of their Friends, kept no manner of ſtrict Guard; this Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe brought a ſtrange Confuſion upon the Camp, and many Soldiers were killed before they could be awakned; but after a little time theſe cowardly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants were repulſed with a very great Slaughter: The Diſorder however was never the leſs, for the Souldiers who before had ſuffered ſo much in their march,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64918:26"/>began to mutiny, and believing that they were betrayed by their Officers who had brought them thither to be butchered, nothing would ſatisfie them but to return into their own Country. But the Earl who could by no means endure to think of retreating, appeaſed them by changing their diſpair into a deſire of Revenge, he therefore ſent openly to reproach the Emperor with this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous treachery, and to ſollicit the reſt of the Princes to joyn with him, and at once to deliver themſelves from this perſidious <hi>Greek</hi> by razing his Imperial Throne. But the Princes, at the earneſt prayer of <hi>Alexis</hi> who abſolutely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed the action, and offered to make any kind of ſatisfaction to the Earl, made ſuch powerful Remonſtrances to <hi>Raimond,</hi> that in concluſion they not only appeaſed him but alſo obliged him for fear of loſing more time to the prejudice of their great deſign, to take the Oath which was deſired, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did, but in theſe terms, <hi>That he promiſed to enterprize nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the honor or the life of</hi> Alexis, <hi>provided that Prince ſhould inviolably obſerve all that he had promiſed.</hi> But when the Homage came under debate he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted that he would die before he would do it, and that the Emperor and the Princes ought to be abundantly ſatisfied with the Oath which he had taken. From whence they might have learned that the ſame Reſolution in the reſt might have proved no leſs advantagious to them, then their politick Condeſcenſion, for aſſuredly what colour ſoever may be put upon this Action, it can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound much to their Honour in the Hiſtory of their lives. But ſo it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens, that it is the Deſtiny of humane Prudence to be moſt groſly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when for its ſecurity it makes choice of Profitable rather than Honeſt.</p>
                  <p>This dangerous quarrel being in this manner appeaſed, the Princes after having reſolved at a great Council of War immediately to beſiege the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> repaired to <hi>Calcedon</hi> whither alſo the Army of <hi>Raimond</hi> marched up to joyn with the reſt. <hi>Raimond</hi> himſelf and Prince <hi>Bohemond</hi> of whom the jealous Emperor was extreamly ſuſpicious, ſtaying ſtill at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſolicite <hi>Alexis</hi> to ſend the Proviſions for the Army, and according to his promiſe to go and take upon him the Command of the Army, which they the more preſſed that thereby they might be the better aſſured of him; but he ſtill excuſed himſelf from the apprehenſions which he had of the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> who might draw dangerous advantages from his abſence. Whereupon <hi>Bohemond</hi> and the Earl preſently after him having given order for the Proviſions, paſſed the ſtrait and followed the reſt of the Princes towards <hi>Nice;</hi> and in the mean time <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy, Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois,</hi> and Prince <hi>Euſtace</hi> who were yet expected with impatience, after having paſſed the Winte and Lent in <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> Embarquing after Eaſter the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> towards the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> came up with the Chriſtian Army and encamped near that City.</p>

                     <hi>Nice</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and which is famous to this day for the firſt and ſeventh Oecumenical Councils, which were held there againſt the Hereſies of the <hi>Arians</hi> and the Iconoclaſts, was at this time a fair and ſpaious City, liyng about fifteen or ſixteen Leagues from <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> in the middle of a moſt fertile and pleaſant Valley, on all ſides encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with high Mountains, except on the Weſtern Quarter, where the great Lake of <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> which by ſmall Veſſels furniſheth it plentifully with all the Commodities of the Country, ſerves inſtead of a natural Fortification, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it wholly inacceſſible on that ſide. It was encompaſſed with double Walls of an extraordinary thickneſs, and flanked with very fair and lofty Towers, ſtrongly built and placed at convenient diſtance to defend each other, and that part of the Curtain which was between them. It was alſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened without the Counterſcarp with a great retrenchment, admirably Paliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed, and which was extream difficult of acceſs, by reaſon of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Springs and Rivulets, which falling from the Mountains and being ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Fortifications, drowned all the adjacent fields to what degrees the defendants pleaſed.

He himſelf was gone into <hi>Perſia,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> to requeſt the aſſiſtance of all the Princes of his Nation; and returning juſt in the nick of time to ſuccour the City, he poſted himſelf in the Mountains at the ſame time when the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting that ſuch a terrible Enemy was ſo near, began the Siege.</p>
                  <p>However the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> applyed themſelves to a formal Siege, diſtributing their ſeveral Quarters in his open view, their Army being far more numerous then his, and conſiſting in above four hundred thouſand Combatants. <hi>Bohemond,</hi> after he had taken care for Proviſions for the Army in a very plentiful manner, returning to the Camp, poſted himſelf on the Northweſt quarter of the City, with his Nephew <hi>Tancred</hi> who extended his quarter on the right hand even to the Lake. <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> with <hi>Baldwin</hi> took the Right Hand over againſt the Principal Gate of the City, taking up all that ſpace between the North and the Eaſt upon that ſide where the City was moſt ſtrongly fortified. After them upon the South Eaſt quarter encamped <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great in the ſame
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64918:28"/>place, where after their arrival the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and Count <hi>Stephen</hi> were to make their attack ſo ſoon as they ſhould come up. All the South ſide was reſerved for Count <hi>Raymond</hi> who was upon his way in <hi>Bythinia</hi> and not far diſtant from the Camp. That part towards the Weſt South-Weſt which lay upon the Lake, could not be blocked up ſo cloſe but that the Enemies had that way the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of furniſhing themſelves with Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>The Town being in this manner begirt quite round, the beſiegers began briskly with a General Aſſault, which upon the fourteenth day of <hi>May</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the ſame time upon all the ſeveral Quarters, with all kind of military Engines. The Combat was maintained all that day till the darkneſs of the Night obliged them to diſcontinue it, and was again renewed in the Morning with extraordinary fury, though without Effect. For the beſieged were not only gallant men, but every minute in expectation of being relieved by <hi>Soliman,</hi> to whom they had diſpatched an Expreſs both to inform him of their Condition, and to advertiſe him that he might eaſily do it by forcing the Chriſtian Camp on that part which lay to the Southward, which was but as yet very ſlenderly guarded; but it ſo fell out, that the Letters of the Sultan were intercepted that very day as they were going to the Town to aſſure the beſieged that he would not fail the next morning according to their advice to attack that part of the Camp. Notice thereupon was immediately given to Prince <hi>Raymond</hi> who was not far off, who marched with ſuch diligence, that by good Fortune the next morning very early he arrived in the Camp.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner begun to make his Lodgement, but the Turks deſcended from the Mountain and divided themſelves into two great Bodies to attack the Chriſtian Camp in two quarters. One party of them marched to the right, towards the South, believing according to the advice which they had received from the beſieged, that the paſſage there was free, whileſt the other advanced to the Quarter of Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> which lay next the Earl, to prevent his ſending any ſuccours from that part, and thereby to be the better able to put his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned relief into the City.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> But the gallant <hi>Raymond</hi> whom the Turks little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have found there, received them in ſo good a poſture, and charged their Troops, who looked for nothing leſs than ſuch oppoſition, with ſo much fury, that he preſently put them into diſorder, and having routed them and cut the beſt part of them in pieces, the reſt were forced to betake themſelves to a haſty ſlight, purſuing them to the very foot of the Mountains, whilſt <hi>Godfrey</hi> in his quarter dealt in the ſame manner with thoſe who made the falſe attack upon his Poſt. Nevertheleſs the beſieged failed not at all in their Courage, but made a very obſtinate defence, under the Protection of their Walls, whoſe ſtrength was ſo great as bid defiance to all the Engines which were made uſe of againſt them; nor were they out of hopes but that ſtill they ſhould receive the Relief which they had ſent to deſire of <hi>Soliman,</hi> by the way of the Lake which ſtill was open.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt matters ſtood in this poſture, the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Blois,</hi> arrived with their Army in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> and took up their Poſts in the Quarter aſſigned them at the beginning of the Siege. This was the firſt time that the Chriſtian Princes had ſeen all their Forces together, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a review of the Army, they found it to be the moſt gallant and numerous, that ever had been ſeen in any Age. For without computing the Prieſts, Monks, Women, Children and Servants of which the number was infinite, thoſe who were preſent at this general muſter aſſure us, that there were no fewer than ſix hundred thouſand Combatants, of which there were at the leaſt a Hundred thouſand Horſe bravely armed; moreover the Venetians, Genoeſe, and thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> who were Maſters of the Sea, aſſiſted them with a mighty Fleet, and ſupplied this vaſt Army continually with ſtore of Arms, Engines of War and all manner of Proviſions. But that which was moſt admirable, was, that theſe Noble Princes, to avoid the diſpleaſure of Almighty God, which for their horrible diſorders had ruined the former <hi>Cruſades</hi> under the Hermit <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Godeſcale</hi> and Count <hi>Emico,</hi> did by their Authority and Example, and by the powerful Exhortations which the Biſhops continually made to the Soldiers, ſo admirably regulate them, and maintained ſo good and ſevere a Diſcipline,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64918:29"/>that all ſorts of Vices and Debauches, were baniſhed from the Camp.</p>
                  <p>During this, <hi>Soliman</hi> who was reſolved to try the laſt of his skill for the Relief of the Town, upon a ſudden made a deſcent from the Mountains, and made a ſecond attack upon the Quarter of <hi>Raymond,</hi> with a Body of ſixty thouſand men ſuſtained by the Groſs of his whole Army: but the Count, and the reſt of the Princes who were advertiſed of this Deſign of the Enemies, getting betwixt this advanced body and the reſt of the Sultans Army, put them into ſuch a conſternation that they immediately fled leaving four thouſand of their companions dead upon the ſpot, whoſe heads the victorious Chriſtians cutting off, with their Engines threw them over the Walls, thereby to ſtrike the greater Terror into the Hearts of the beſieged. But notwithſtanding all that,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> they continued the defence like brave men, and they were thereto encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged both by reaſon that the Lake being free and open they received every day ſome little relief or other; as alſo becauſe there were among the Turks of this Garriſon many reſolute men, who had determined never to abandon the defence of the place but with their lives, and among others one whoſe bravery, though mixed with too much of the brutal, was ſuch, that he was from one of the Towers which he defended, looked upon by the whole Chriſtian Army with aſtoniſhment, and his Actions ſeemed the Prodigies of Valour and Courage.</p>
                  <p>This valiant man who by reaſon of his huge Bulk, extraordinary Strength, and the Fierceneſs of his barbarous and menacing Air, ſeemed much to reſemble a Giant, defended one of the ſtrong Towers which were aſſaulted by Count <hi>Raymond;</hi> he had been often repulſed, but yet repeated the ſurious Attack, when this monſtrous <hi>Turk</hi> coming to the Platform, made a terrible havock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Aſſailants, tumbling down with a mighty impetuoſity ſuch as had mounted the ſcaling Ladders, wounding them with ſuch vaſt Arrows as no Shield nor Curiaſs was able to reſiſt. And not herewith contented, he inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſt intollerably over the Chriſtians who ſell under his Arms, with all the bitter and bloody ralleries imaginable; for being attacked on all hands he could not forbear calling them feeble and effeminate Cowards, who were ſitter for the Diſtaff than the Lance; and finding that his Bow and Arrows were not ſufficient to drive off the Aſſailants, who preſſed hard to the foot of the Wall, he threw away his Buckler and his Arms, and expoſing himſelf naked to an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Arrows which were ſhot at him, he with both his hands fell to throwing down ſtones of a prodigious bigneſs upon thoſe who were attempting to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Wall; and which is almoſt incredible, if we were not aſſured from thoſe who were Eye witneſſes of the Spectacle, though he had above twenty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſticking in him that his Breaſt looked as if it were briſtled with them, yet he did not ceaſe to throw down ſtones upon the Aſſailants, nor to beſtow his reproachful language upon them, till Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> who was come thither from his own quarter, not able to indure this inſolence of a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> with a well placed Arrow ſhot him through the very heart, and tumbled him dead into the Ditch. Thus the braveſt man of the Turks ſeemed to ſtay to receive an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death from the hand of the gallanteſt of the Chriſtians.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> they begun to enter into a Treaty with the Emperors People, who from the very beginning of the Siege had ſecretly ſolicited them by his Lieutenant to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the place to him with great promiſes of advantage; and though the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſcovered this cunning Treaty and the perſidiouſneſs of <hi>Alexis,</hi> yet they did not in the leaſt oppoſe the Rendition of the place unto him; ſo after a Siege of ſeven weeks the Town was ſurrendred upon Articles to the Emperor; and he to gain the good opinion of the Infidels if they ſhould one day attempt to reconquer it, cauſing the Wife and two ſons of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and the whole Turkiſh Garriſon to be tranſported to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> gave them all the kind Treatment imaginable, endeavouring thereby to draw them to his Service. During which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64918:29"/>time, that he might the better conceal his cowardly Treachery under the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhews, he made moſt magnificent Preſents to all the principal Commanders, and beſtowed good Largeſſes upon the poor Soldiers, that he might after a faſhion make them ſome Satisfaction for the loſs of the Spoils of the Vanquiſhed, which he had promiſed them before the taking of the City. But this perſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince was reſolved to perform nothing of what he had promiſed to the <hi>Franks,</hi> and having drawn all the Advantages he poſſibly could from them, at the laſt to work their Ruine and Deſtruction; which without doubt he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, if his former Treacheries had not been too frequent and apparent to doubt of his Intentions, and the Diſtruſt which the Princes and whole Army had of this wicked Man, was the reaſon that they were always upon their Guard againſt him; and the Soldiers who were not given much to Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the caſe, charged him openly every Day with whole Vollies of Curſes and thouſands of Execrations.</p>
                  <p>After the Reduction of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Princes that they might not loſe that commodious Seaſon of the Year, marched immediately towards <hi>Syria,</hi> and the third day after, for the conveniency of Forrage and Subſiſtence; they ſeparated into two Bodies, <hi>Bohemond</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Blois,</hi> taking the left hand, and <hi>Godfrey</hi> with the other Princes, the right, but yet without diſtancing the Armies above two Miles aſunder. And certainly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared quickly that this laſt Precaution was not without great Prudence as well as Neceſſity; for three days after this Separation, as <hi>Bohemond</hi> was got into a large Vally, called the <hi>Gorgonian</hi> Plain, where he incamped in the Night, upon the Brink of the <hi>Rivulet</hi> which runs through it, he was advertiſed by his Scouts, that he was like to have the whole Army of the Sultan upon his Hands; for <hi>Soliman</hi> after his Repulſe at <hi>Nice,</hi> being reinforced with new Troops, coaſted along the Coverture of the Mountains, on the left hand of the <hi>Christians</hi> with three hundred and ſixty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> all Horſe, with an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number alſo of <hi>Arabians,</hi> who were alſo Cavalry; and having by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpials underſtood that <hi>Bohemond,</hi> who had the leaſt part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, was ingaged in that Valley, he doubted not but ſo to ſurround him, as to cut them all in pieces, without their being able to defend themſelves; and therefore in the Night he ſecretly paſſed the Valley, intending to ſurprize the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next Morning upon their decamping;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> he therefore ſeized by break of Day upon all the Paſſes of the Hills, extending his Troops to the right and left, and placing them at the ſeveral Avenues leading out of the Valley.</p>
                  <p>And no ſooner was <hi>Bohemond</hi> advertiſed hereof by his Scouts, but he alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the huge Clouds of Duſt which roſe from the Mountains, and heard the horrible Cries of this vaſt Multitude of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who made the Valley re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound with their dreadful Shouts, thereby to terrify and ſurpriſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and within two Moments after he perceived <hi>Soliman</hi> himſelf advancing at the head of his beſt Troops, followed with one hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe, who whileſt the other made a halt upon the Hills, came powring down into the Valley, to Charge the Chriſtians, whom he expected to find half Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by their own Fear and Diſorder. But <hi>Bohemond,</hi> whoſe Soul was not to be ſhaken, and who by a long Experience in War, had a mighty preſence of Mind in the moſt dangerous Occaſions; did, without the leaſt mark of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perform whatſoever was neceſſary, either to avoid or to defer the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which in this Extremity ſeemed Inevitable. He immediately diſpatched ſome Cavaliers to advertiſe Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> of the Danger which threatned him, and gave Command to the Infantry inſtantly to remove the Camp into a place between the <hi>Rivulet,</hi> and a great Morraſs all covered with Reeds, and to make a Paliſade of the Stakes which ſerved them in ſetting up their Tents, and to fortify that with a ſecond Circumference of the Waggons and Carriages: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, having placed himſelf at the Head of the Cavalry with the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Blois,</hi> they incouraged the Soldiers by their Looks, Geſture and Voice, exhorting them couragiouſly to Encounter thoſe Enemies, whom they might more juſtly deſpiſe than fear, having twice before ſeen them turn their Backs; and aſſuring them that they ſhould immediately receive Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from their Companions, and that they could not poſſibly however but upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64918:30"/>this Occaſion obtain immortal Glory, either by Death or Conqueſt. And thereupon with an invincible Fierceneſs they led them to the Charge; but the <hi>Turks</hi> at the ſame Inſtant, by the Command of <hi>Soliman</hi> made a Halt, till ſuch time as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who came to the Charge with their Lances in the Reſt, were within Bow-ſhot, and then the <hi>Turks</hi> poured upon them a whole ſhower of Arrows, and immediately wheeled off, yet all the time that they ſeemed to ſlye they ceaſed not to ſhoot their Arrows againſt thoſe that purſued them, and ever as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> retreated to the groſs Body, facing about and charging them as before; this new ſort of Combat did extreamly incommode the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who could not come to Blows with the Enemy, and yet loſt abundance of their Horſe which were wounded with the Arrows: In the mean time the other part of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army having forced the Camp, made there moſt terrible Havock, plundring and killing without Mercy the Women, Children, and Eccleſiaſticks, and other defenceleſs People.</p>
                  <p>The Soldiers oppreſſed by the multitude of their Enemies, were at their laſt, and all was in a manner loſt when <hi>Bohemond,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> to whom this News was brought, came ſlying to their Aſſiſtance with a party of the Cavalry: But in the mean time <hi>Soliman</hi> who ſaw his Deſign thrive ſo well, charged ſo furiouſly upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that after a long Reſiſtance they began to give ground; but the brave Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> ſnatching a white Cornet embroidered with Gold, from the hands of him that carried it, and who was carried away with the Crowd of thoſe that fled, he cried aloud, <hi>It is the Will of God,</hi> and at the ſame time he threw himſelf into the thickeſt of the Enemies, followed by a ſmall number of brave Men who accompanied him; this brave Action raiſed ſo much Shame and Courage among the reſt, that as if they had all on the ſuddain been inſpired with new Vigor, they ſpurred up at full ſpeed after him into the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Squadrons of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> overturning all on every ſide that oppoſed their Paſſage: This Heat was much more increaſed by the return of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> who having Repulſed the <hi>Arabs</hi> who came with no other Deſign but that of Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, were not able to ſuſtain the firſt Shock of his Cavalry, who threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a Lion into the throng of his Enemies to rejoyn the Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> who after he had renewed the Combat ſeemed to ſuſtain his People more by his Courage and Example than by the ſtrength of their Arms; for what with Wearineſs, the heat of the Sun, and intolerable Thirſt, their Force was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, that they had much to do to ſuſtain the Combate.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that even the Women upon this Occaſion ſignalized their Courage, in the midſt of a thouſand Darts and Arrows carrying them Water from the <hi>Rivulet</hi> to refreſh them, but alas this ſmall Succor was too little to ballance the greatneſs of their Diſtreſs, for being oppreſſed by the infinite number of their Enemies, who enlarged their Squadrons to the right and left, with a deſign to encompaſs them, having loſt a great many brave Men, and among the reſt Prince <hi>William</hi> the Brother of <hi>Tancred,</hi> they were obliged to give way and retire, all the way of the Retreat facing their Enemies, till they came to the Camp, where they hoped by the favour of the Retrenchments to ſecure themſelves from the danger of being incloſed by their Enemies. But now the <hi>Arabs</hi> had alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their Attack, perceiving that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were repulſed, and they purſued their Point ſo home, that the Army was reduced to the utmoſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and in all appearance, could not poſſibly long reſiſt the Force of ſo many Enemies, when the firſt Squadrons of Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Army, who haſted to their Succor began to appear.

                     <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army in the Plain, retreated towards the Hills from whence he came in the Morning, not imagining that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would there dare to attack him. But he quickly found he had deluded himſelf; for no ſooner were the Earls of <hi>Vermandois</hi> and <hi>Tholoſe</hi> come up, but the whole Army was put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battle, juſt about Noon, without giving ſo much as time for thoſe who had been engaged already, to take their repaſt, except whileſt they were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into their Order. The <hi>Norman</hi> Princes, that is, Duke <hi>Robert, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Tancred,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Prince of <hi>Salernum</hi> his Coſin, had the left Battalion upon that ſide towards the Entrance into the Valley, Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> with his two Brothers, and the Earls of <hi>Vermandois</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> were upon the right, Count <hi>Raymond</hi> led the main Body betwixt thoſe two, inclining a little to the left, that way where the acceſs to the Mountain was leſs Difficult, the Horſe were diſpoſed upon the Wings and in the Intervals of the Battle, and the two Points, to the intent they might the better ſuſtain the Infantry upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The Princes in drawing up the Squadrons, animated the Soldiers by the ſight of the Croſs which they carried in the Colours, and upon their Coats, thereby to remind them of their Vow which they had made, to vanquiſh or to dye for the Glory of him, who for their Salvation died upon the Croſs; they remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to ſome of them, <hi>That the Enemies they were to Combat, were thoſe whom they had two ſeveral times before Vanquiſhed at</hi> Nice; <hi>that they were for the moſt part cowardly</hi> Arabians, <hi>accustomed rather to ſteal than fight, and who were not uſed to ſet upon their Enemies but like Thieves to robb them by Surprize, as they did now upon the Army after it was divided: But now that they ſaw them conjoyned, they ſhewed plainly by the little aſſurance of their Countenances, and their ſuddain Retreat, that the very ſight of their Vanquiſhers had taken away their Courage and their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they ought to be looked upon as half beaten before the Engagement:</hi> They told others, <hi>That in fighting valiantly as the Soldiers of</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>and under his Conduct, they went to a moſt aſſured Happineſs, either in Heaven by the glorious Crown of Martyrdom, if they died in this Battle, or if they ſurvived it, they might expect on Earth the Riches and the Spoils of all</hi> Aſia, <hi>as the product of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> And that they might be underſtood by all, and ſpeak all in one Word, they cried with a loud Voice, and with all their Force, as they paſſed from Rank to Rank, lifting up one Hand to Heaven, and with the other drawing their Swords, <hi>It is the Will of God, It is the Will of God.</hi> Whereupon the whole Army repeated the ſame Words, with ſuch a terrible Harmony, that the Hills, the Vallies, the Rocks, and Mountains ſhook with the dreadful Eccho, which repeated a million of times, <hi>It is the Will of God, It is the Will of God.</hi> After which Prayers being made, and the Biſhops having given them their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the whole Army moved gently in a moſt beautiful Order towards the Enemy, who all this time ſtood firm without the leaſt Motion, in his Poſt, that he might thereby ſecure the Advantage he had taken.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> covered with their Bucklers, had ſuſtained the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who darkned the very Skye with the infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their Arrows, Count <hi>Raymond</hi> without giving them leiſure to make a ſecond Charge, ran at full ſpeed, with Lance in Reſt, upon their Squadrons, with the whole Body of his Cavalry, and they being unable to ſuſtain ſo rude a Shock as was given them by the <hi>European</hi> Lancers, to which they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shields nor Breſt-plates to oppoſe, were overthrown and tumbled down Horſe and Man.</p>
                  <p>The Infantry which followed them cloſe, then entring, as at a Breach, with their Swords in their Hands, without ever regarding the Enemies Arrows, made an extraordinary Carnage, both amongſt the Men and Horſes; whileſt in the mean time <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Bohemond,</hi> who had extended their Squadrons to hinder the Enemies Wings from encompaſſing them, charged them in the Flank, and fought with good Succeſs; but that which compleated the Ruine of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> was, that the Biſhop of <hi>Pavia,</hi> who according as was agreed among the Princes, having marched his Body behind the Mountain upon the left hand, immediately fell upon their Rere, which he aſſailed moſt vigorouſly, and with mighty Shoots, thereby the more to terrify and aſtoniſh them. For immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who were not acquainted with ſighting hand to hand, and who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64918:31"/>feared to be ſurrounded between the two Armies, began to betake themſelves to their Heels, and in concluſion, the Fear and the Diſorder which diſperſed itſelf over the whole Army, put them in a moment to a general Rout; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them ſaving themſelves by the ſwiftneſs of their Horſes, which it was in vain to hope to overtake by the heavy Cavalry of the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they purſued them till Night, killing many who in their Flight incumbred one another, ſo as they could not make that haſt which their Fear and Danger required from them. Their Camp immediately fell into the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> wherein the Soldiers according as the Generals had promiſed them, inriched themſelves with a prodigious quantity of Booty and Plunder which they found there. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in theſe two Combats loſt not above four thouſand Men, among which, only three Perſons of Quality who were ſlain in the firſt Attaque, <hi>William</hi> the Brother of <hi>Tancred, Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Aigremont,</hi> and the moſt valiant <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>Infidels</hi> left there upon the place, beſides a prodigious number of the <hi>Arabs</hi> and their other ordinary Soldiers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three thouſand of the principal perſons of Quality among the <hi>Turks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who of all the <hi>Infidels</hi> fought the moſt valiantly in that Battle.</p>
                  <p>The Victorious Army after having refreſhed themſelves two days in this Valley,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> now famous for this glorious Victory, put themſelves upon their March, advancing towards <hi>Syria,</hi> all the way following the Track of the flying Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and this Prince having after the Battle met with ten thouſand freſh <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> which came to Reinforce him, and upon the Road having called the ſcattered Fugitives, he applied himſelf to lay all the Country waſt through which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was to march; this reduced them to extream Want, eſpecially in their Paſſage over the Mountains and the Deſerts; ſo that the defect of Proviſions, and the Thirſt, occaſioned by the exceſſive Heats, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to thoſe Extremities, that five hundred Perſons died in one day, and almoſt all the Horſes periſhed. But at laſt, having gotten out of thoſe Straits, they arrived about <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> which ſurrendered to them without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as did moſt of the other Cities in their Paſſage through <hi>Lycaonia, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> and <hi>Armenia.</hi> For the generality of the Inhabitants being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> not daring to appear in the Field, being baffled in all the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters upon the Way, and therefore unable to protect them, thoſe places ſent to the Princes to render themſelves to their Protection; they received the Princes with all ſort of Submiſſion, and by a thouſand Teſtimonies of Rejoycing, made it appear with what infinite Pleaſure they ſaw themſelves delivered from the inſupportable Yoak of Slavery, which had been impoſed upon them by the <hi>Infidels.</hi> And therefore ſeizing upon <hi>Iconium, Ceſaria</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> ſometimes a famous City, though now almoſt wholy Ruinous, <hi>Heraclia</hi> upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> the Princes placed Governors in them, retaining them under their own Juriſdiction. For they thought themſelves wholy diſengaged from the Oath which they had made to the perfidious <hi>Alexis,</hi> who had not obſerved in any ſort the Agreement which he had ſworn to them. Thus it muſt happen to ſuch cowardly Princes, who not believing themſelves obliged to ſubmit to the Laws which they themſelves have made, and to which they have given their moſt ſolemn Faith, they gain nothing, in concluſion, by their Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Diſappointment of their Expectations, and the unprofitable Shame, by breaking their Word, of being eſteemed diſhoneſt and unworthy Men.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the Army refreſhed themſelves in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> after ſuch Toyls and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Prince <hi>Godfrey</hi> had like to have been loſt by a ſtrange Accident, which however redounded in concluſion much to the Honour of this Prince, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing his Reputation, Courage, and Nobleneſs, which appeared even to Admiration upon this dangerous Occaſion. For one day entring alone upon Horſeback into a Wood, where he hoped to have the Pleaſure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining himſelf ſome Moments in Solitude, he heard the Voice of a Man who cried out for Help with all his Power, and advancing to the place from whence the Noiſe came, he preſently underſtood the Cauſe; for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was a poor Soldier, who coming to cut Wood, was running quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of Breath, round about a great Tree, to ſave himſelf from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64918:31"/>Jaws of a monſtrous and furious Bear,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> which was juſt ready to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Godfrey</hi> did not long deliberate what he was to do, but tranſported with his Courage and his Charity, to ſee the Danger of one of his Soldiers, he ſpur'd on his Horſe with his Sword in his hand, towards the cruel Beaſt, who abandoning her firſt Prey, with her Eyes inflamed and her gaping Jaws, and the terrible Claws of her two fore Paws, advanced towards him, and raiſing herſelf upon her hinder Feet to throw herſelf upon the Horſe, but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the glittering Sword, to avoid the Blow ſhe fell ſidelong, yet ſo that Horſe and Man came over her, ſhe catched hold of the Dukes Coat to draw him towards her, but <hi>Godfrey</hi> nimbly recovering his Fall, and ſeizing upon her left Paw, which ſhe had thruſt out to lay hold upon him, he plunged his Sword up to the very Hilt, in the Belly of this monſtrous Enemy, when at the ſame time one of his Gentlemen named <hi>Huſequin,</hi> who was following the Hounds, came running in at the horrible Cries of the Bear and the Soldier, and put an end to the Life of the Beaſt, already overthrown by the terrible Blow which ſhe had received; but the Duke having in drawing his Sword af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fall, from between his Leggs, given himſelf a cruel Wound in his Thigh, which during the heat of the Combat he never perceived, he had loſt ſo much Blood, that after the heat of his Spirits which kept him up, began to remit, he immediately ſunk down in a Swoon. This Accident, tho in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not Dangerous, yet ſpread a mighty Conſternation throughout the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as if all had been loſt: For altho he had not the abſolute Command of a General, there being ſo many Princes, and the Sons of two Kings, ſo that all things were done by Conſent and an equality of Power, yet nevertheleſs he had ſo much Authority, and ſo much Deference was given to his Judgment, that one ſhall not need to make any Scruple in ſaying he was the Chief, eſpecially ſince the Battle of the <hi>Gorgonian</hi> Valley, where by his Valour he not only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Army of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> but gained the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a moſt glorious Victory, by ſnatching it out of the hands of the <hi>Infidels</hi> when they were juſt upon the point of conſummating it.</p>
                  <p>But not long after, it ſo happened, that Ambition, Jealouſie, and the deſire of Revenge, three Paſſions far more dangerous than the moſt furious Beaſts, produced Effects more deplorable to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, than what had like to have befallen them by this monſtrous Bear, who failed in his Attempt againſt the Duke, who was the Soul and Spirit of the Army. For while they lay in <hi>Piſidia</hi> refreſhing themſelves, waiting the Recovery of the Duke, his Brother <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Tancred,</hi> two young Princes, whom the love of Glory had already rendred Rivals, entred into <hi>Cilicia</hi> by two different Ways, with two little Armies, to make themſelves Maſters of ſuch Places as they could Conquer, which by the Conſent of the other Princes they were to hold, and eſtabliſh there their little Principalities. <hi>Tancred</hi> who took the more eaſy way, all along the Sea Coaſt, came firſt before <hi>Tarſus,</hi> the Capital City of that Province, and having beaten the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon who came out to ſight him, the Inhabitants who were for the moſt part <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſubmitted to him, and planted his Enſigns upon one of the principal Towers of the City. <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> who followed by the long and difficult way of the Mountains, came in juſt as theſe matters had paſſed, and was taken by <hi>Tancred</hi> for ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer who was come to relieve the Garriſon, as alſo by a mutual Miſtake, <hi>Baldwin</hi> diſcovering <hi>Tancred</hi>'s Forces with Sword in Hand, marching up towards him, concluded him to be the Governor of the Garriſon of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> who was come out to oppoſe his Paſſage; but diſcovering their Error, they Embraced each other as if they had been very well ſatisfied; but within a few Moments <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> being unable to indure that his Rival ſhould have the Glory to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him in the eaſy Conqueſt of ſo fair a City, and finding himſelf ſtronger in Number, he would needs have recourſe to Arms to oblige <hi>Tancred</hi> to yield to him half the Conqueſt. <hi>Tancred</hi> who was every whit as Brave and as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant as <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and without doubt far more Moderate, diſſembling this Affront for the preſent, generouſly reſigned it intirely to him, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be reduced to the miſerable Neceſſity of drawing his Sword againſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and Confederates, he thought of ſeeking new Conqueſts, and among

                  <p>Prince <hi>Baldwin</hi> happened by an odd Adventure to be reinforced by a Fleet of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Pyrats Commanded by a <hi>Bullener,</hi> one <hi>Vinomare,</hi> who had been a Domeſtick formerly to his Father Count <hi>Eustace.</hi> This Captain by pure Accident was come to an Anchor before <hi>Tarſus</hi> at the ſame time when <hi>Baldwin</hi> had taken the Town, and being Raviſhed to meet there the Son of his old Maſter, and ſo fair an Occaſion to change his Employ, by taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many famous <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, in ſo glorious a Cauſe, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately joyned Prince <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who placed one part of his Men in Garriſon at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> and deſired him to ſtay with the remainder in the Road there, till he ſhould ſend him further Orders. After which, this Prince having aſſured his new Conqueſt, marched to make others, and came one Evening to Encamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mamiſtra,</hi> where <hi>Tancred,</hi> who had juſt taken the Place, was buſie in giving the neceſſary Orders for the Fortification of it, to render it ſtronger than before. There is nothing more eaſy than to revive the remembrance and ſenſe of an Injury in a Heart already grieved to have received it, and aſhamed not to have revenged it, eſpecially being excited thereunto by the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of new Affronts and Outrages. <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Salernum</hi> his Couſin, thinking that this Action of <hi>Bohemond</hi> was a ſecond Injury which he came to offer, blew up the Flames of Diſſention between them, accoſting <hi>Tancred</hi> in theſe Terms. <hi>Ha! what now</hi> Tancred (ſaid he) <hi>where is thy Honor? Thou has formerly been taken for Valor it ſelf, wilt thou now diſabuſe the World, and reverſe that fair Opinion, by making it evident that thou art the greatest Coward of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? What! Canſt thou ſuffer</hi> Baldwin, <hi>after having conſtrained thee in the moſt fierce and inſolent manner in the World, to quit thy Pretenſions to</hi> Tarſus, <hi>to come and Reproach thee with the Injury he hath done thee, and which thou haſt tamely born; and it may be to command thee to relinquiſh</hi> Maniſtra <hi>too, whileſt he aſſures himſelf thereof, by that which thou art pleaſed to call Moderation, but he believes to be pure Cowardice? Go, go then, if thou haſt not quite loſt thy Heart, but go as thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, at the head of ſo many brave Men, who are reſolved to periſh, rather than not be revenged of the inſufferable Affront which is done not only to</hi> Tancred, <hi>but to all the generous</hi> Normans, <hi>who have not conquered</hi> Calabria, Pavia, <hi>and</hi> Sicily, <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the</hi> Grecian <hi>Emperor, and followed the Invincible</hi> Bohemond <hi>through all</hi> Aſia, <hi>there to become Slaves to one</hi> Bullener.</p>
                  <p>This did not fail to raiſe the Courage of <hi>Tancred,</hi> and to rouſe up that Anger, which he had not been able without extreme Violence to ſmother at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> and Shame having removed all the Obſtacles which Virtue oppoſed, his Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler breaking out like a River ſwollen with a mighty Inundation, was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come furious; and amidſt the Noiſe which this turbulent Paſſion raiſed in his Soul, he was no longer in a condition to give Attention either to Conſcience, Reaſon, or the Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, for whoſe only Sake he had taken Arms; but that he haſtily ſnatched them up to employ them againſt his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſo that taking five hundred choſen Horſe, and two hundred Archers, he put himſelf at the head of them, and advanced to attack Prince <hi>Baldwin:</hi> and he ſeeing them coming in this manner, put himſelf immediately into a poſture to receive them. The Combat was rough and bloody, in regard that both the one and the other fought rather by the Dictates of Fury than the Rules of Art, and that the Combatants were all in the rank of the moſt valiant Men of the World. It happened however in concluſion, that <hi>Tancred</hi> quitted the Field, and retired before <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who outnumbred him in Cavalry. <hi>Baldwin</hi> purſued his Advantage briskly till they came to the paſſage of a little Bridge, where <hi>Richard</hi> Prince of <hi>Salernum,</hi> and <hi>Robert de Anſe,</hi> were taken Priſoners. <hi>Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Clermont</hi> who was engaged too eagerly in the Purſuit, had the ſame Fortune to be taken by <hi>Tancred;</hi> and many gallant Men loſt their Lives on
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64918:32"/>both ſides in this unfortunate Day. But it happened that the two Captains,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> without a poſſibility of communicating their Thoughts to each other, having in the Night conſidered in their cooler Thoughts, that their unhappy Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which already had done too much Miſchief, might occaſion the Diviſion of the whole Army, and in the end impeach the Progreſs of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arms, and the accompliſhment of their Vow; they therefore repented them of their raſh Folly, by an extraordinary Effect of Gods immediate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in whoſe Hands are the Hearts of Princes, to turn them as he pleaſeth. So that the next morning ſending reciprocally, and in the ſame Inſtant, their Ambaſſadors to each other, they both deſired that Peace, which was therefore in a moment concluded, the Priſoners being on both ſides reſtored to Liberty, and the Princes imbracing each other with a thouſand Proteſtations of a future Amity. So it is, when Peace is made between Princes with Sincerity, and by the Mediation of God Almighty, it is eaſily accorded, and of long continuance, but when it is only the Work of Politick Men, who cannot give it, it is not concluded without long Debates and Conteſts, which look like a little kind of War, and when it is concluded, it continues no longer than while they take Breath, and can make better Preparations to break it.</p>
                  <p>After this happy Peace, <hi>Tancred</hi> having joyned to his Troops the remainder of the Forces of the Pyrates, eaſily conquered the reſt of <hi>Cilicia</hi> even to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandretta,</hi> whileſt <hi>Baldwin</hi> having made a great Progreſs in <hi>Armenia,</hi> whither he was gone to joyn the groſs of the Army, was called to the Principality of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> where he eſtabliſhed himſelf by that Adventure, which I am now about to relate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edeſſa</hi> an ancient and famous City of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> known in the ſacred Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Name of <hi>Rages,</hi> which it afterwards changed into that of <hi>Rohais,</hi> and which at this day is called <hi>Orfa,</hi> was in times paſt under the Power of the ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> who governed it under the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken from him this Province, yet it was ſtill maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a little Principality, paying a certain Tribute to theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ceaſed not to Tyrannize over this poor City, now hopeleſs of all Succours. The Inhabitants, who were all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> having heard of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Actions of Prince <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who puſhed on his Conqueſts as far as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> defeating the <hi>Turks</hi> in all Encounters, obliged their Prince to ſend to him, to deſire his Aſſiſtance, and to offer him the honorable Terms of being his adopted Son, and declared Succeſſor. <hi>Baldwin</hi> did not refuſe ſo fair an Occaſion, which his good Fortune ſeemed to offer him, by poſſeſſing him of ſo conſiderable an Eſtate in <hi>Aſia.</hi> He adventured therefore to paſs the <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> being followed by not above one hundred Horſe, which were all he could ſpare from the keeping ſuch important Places which he had Conquered; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs with this little Troop he baſſled the <hi>Turks,</hi> who either openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Paſſage, or laid Ambuſcades in his Way to ſurprize him; and entring <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> he was received with ſuch extraordinary Acclamations and Honors, that the good old Man who had adopted him, conceived ſuch a Jealouſy of him, that repenting of what he had done, he reſolved in ſhort, to get quit of him, and ſend him back at any rate. But <hi>Baldwin,</hi> after he had in two or three Rencounters with the <hi>Turks</hi> who poſſeſſed all the Country about <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> given a Taſt of his Courage and Conduct; the whole Populace, who were ripe for ſuch a Revolution, and wanted only an Occaſion to revenge themſelves of a thouſand Evils which they had ſuffered under the Government of this Covetous old Man, ran immediately to their Arms, and beſieged the Caſtle; and notwithſtanding all the Prayers and Oppoſition which <hi>Baldwin</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Intentions, they cut this miſerable Man in pieces, whileſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to eſcape by throwing himſelf from a Window oppoſite to that Quarter which was aſſaulted. After which, notwithſtanding all the Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which <hi>Baldwin</hi> either had, or feigned to have, thereby to ſhew that he had no ſhare in ſo horrid an Action, he was conſtrained the next Morning to permit himſelf to be ſolemnly proclaimed Prince of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> and to be put in Poſſeſſion of the Treaſure of the deceaſed Prince, which according to the Deſtiny of Covetous Men, he had ſcraped together for another, who knew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64918:33"/>how to employ it better than himſelf. For with one part of it he bought the ſtrong Town of <hi>Samoſata</hi> upon the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he who held it, thinking it better Husbandry prudently to ſell it at a good Rate, than to expoſe himſelf to the danger of loſing it for nothing: and with another part he levied good Troops, with which he took all the places which were capable of incommoding <hi>Edeſſa:</hi> and in ſhort, in a ſmall time he eſtabliſhed a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Eſtate, extending it on both ſides both towards the South from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> as far as <hi>Selencia</hi> upon the <hi>Tygris</hi> and towards the North as far as the ſtrong places upon Mount <hi>Taurus.</hi> He had alſo the dexterity and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to unite to his Principality a great part of <hi>Armenia</hi> by an alliance with one of his Princes whoſe Neice he married, after the death of the generous <hi>Gundechilda</hi> his Lady, who having followed him, died at <hi>Mareſia</hi> during the March of the Army of the Confederate Princes.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt Prince <hi>Baldwin</hi> made ſuch a marvellous Progreſs on this ſide of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army having reduced all the leſſer <hi>Armenia,</hi> took the Road through <hi>Comagena</hi> towards <hi>Syria,</hi> and drew within fifteen miles of <hi>Antioch,</hi> after having taken the City of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof having cut the throats of the Turkiſh Garriſon, had opened their Gates to the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was advanced with a thouſand choice horſe to receive it. He there made a defence for divers days with a great deal of Courage and glory againſt twenty thouſand Turks, who came from <hi>Antioch</hi> to retake it, and who after a terrible Aſſault which they maintained for one whole day, were conſtrained to retire upon the Approach of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, to defend the paſs of a Bridge upon the <hi>Orontes</hi> about two or three Leagues from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> After the repoſe of a few dayes, during which <hi>Tancred</hi> and the reſt of the Lords except Count <hi>Baldwin,</hi> came to rejoyn the Army, it was reſolved notwithſtanding the Seaſon was now far advanced to beſiege this great City, in regard the Reputation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arms, and the happy Succeſs of their great deſign ſeemed abſolutely to depend upon the taking of <hi>Antioch</hi> which covered the Country of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> This reſolution was no ſooner taken, but it was put in immediate Execution: for the next morning <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who led the Vanguard of the Army, fell ſmartly upon the Bridge, which the Turks who never behaved themſelves better than upon this occaſion as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly maintained; but the Biſhop of <hi>Pavia</hi> coming up to reinforce them, did ſo animate the Normans and the Engliſh, that ſome of them having forced the Barricadoes, and the two Towers which commanded the Bridge, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers paſſing over the Shallows, and ſome throwing themſelves into the River ſwam over, they put the Turks to ſlight and opened the paſſage for the whole Army. That Night they encamped near the River, and the next day which was Wedneſday the twenty firſt of <hi>October,</hi> putting themſelves in order of Battle, and adorning themſelves in their faireſt Arms, with Trumpets found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Colours flying, the whole Army marched as it were in a terrible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and encamped within a mile of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antioch</hi> ſo renowned in the Greek and Latin Hiſtories, and which at preſent conſiſts only of ſome part of the beautiful Ruines where ſometime that noble City ſtood, was at that time one of the faireſt and largeſt Cities in the World, giving place to none for the ſtrength which both Art and Nature had beſtowed upon it. It was ſituated in a moſt fertile and delicious Plain between the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Amanus</hi> and <hi>Orontes,</hi> upon the River of that name, whoſe Stream flowed along by the Walls on the Weſtern ſide, being within four or five leagues of its mouth: The Town was in length from the Eaſt to the Weſt above a league, without comprehending the Suburbs which were very large. There were two Mountains between the South and Eaſt ſeparated by a narrow Valley through which a little River ſlid along into the <hi>Orontes,</hi> all the way of its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage watring the inward part of the City; for theſe two mountains and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſer Hills were all within the Circumference of the Walls, which were of an extraordinary height and thickneſs, and defended by above four hundred fair Towers, a mighty deep Ditch, and a Counter-Scarp well fortified with Paliſado's, and invironed with a Moraſs and Pools of water in thoſe parts where by reaſon of their lying upon the plain the Avenues to the City lay more eaſie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64918:33"/>of acceſs. And beſides all this there was a powerful Army of Turks within the place for its defence, as alſo two Caſtles upon the Mountain, in one of which was the Palace of <hi>Sultan Accien,</hi> who reigned in <hi>Antioch</hi> fourteen years after the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken it from the <hi>Saraſens;</hi> and as he had a long time to foreſee that the Army of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt come upon him in their paſſage into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> he had uſed all imaginable diligence to furniſh himſelf which all things neceſſary to ſuſtain a long Siege; hoping in that time to receive great ſuccours from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Princes, and eſpecially the Sultan of <hi>Perſia</hi> who had promiſed not to fail him, and whom <hi>Soliman</hi> was gone to ſolicit in the common Cauſe.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> And that which rendred this attempt moſt extream difficult, was, not only the Greatneſs but the Situation of the City, which would not admit of being wholly invironed, but that there was free Egreſs and Regreſs for Succours to come to the beſieged.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army conſiſted not now in above three hundred thouſand men, the Sieges, the Battles, the Diſeaſes and Diſertions, and other loſſes which they had ſuſtained in their Paſſage over the Mountains and Deſerts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Garriſons which they were obliged to put in the conquered Places, had reduced them to one half; but nevertheleſs the Princes according to the reſolution which they had taken, did not ceaſe to form the Siege in this following manner: All the South ſide was left open, by reaſon that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to attack the City on that ſide, in regard of the Rock and Mountains which rendred the Paſſage inacceſſible: So that they were contented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron it on the ſide of the Plain, beginning at the foot of the Mountain on the Eaſt, and ſo drawing by the North towards the Weſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town and the River, which in that part for about a mile came ſo near the Weſtern part, that it ſerved for a Ditch upon that Quarter. Prince <hi>Bohemond</hi> and <hi>Tancred</hi> took their Poſt over againſt the Eaſtern Gate called St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Gate through which they go to the famous and delightful Suburb of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> ſometimes ſo celebrated for the Temple and Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much more for the Tomb of that illuſtrious Martyr <hi>Babylas,</hi> who ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Devil for ever giving any more doubtful Anſwers to the fooliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers. <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great, the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> were poſted at the Right, drawing more towards the North to the Port commonly called the Dogs Gate. The Earl of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Pavia,</hi> were encamped before that Gate, and poſſeſſed all the ſpace between that and the third Gate, which afterwards was called the Dukes Gate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> with his <hi>Lorrainers</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> was poſted there, his Quarters being extended to that place where the <hi>Orontes</hi> beginning to turn from the North to the Weſt, ſlides down by the Walls of <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo that the greateſt part of the Army was encamped between the Town and the River, which was there paſſed by a large ſtone Bridge juſt over againſt the fourth Gate of the Town, which was therefore called the Bridge Gate. This Gate was alſo open to the beſieged as well as that of St. <hi>Georges</hi> upon the Weſt, by reaſon that the River was between theſe two Gates and the Beſiegers, who by an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror not eaſily to be excuſed, did not at firſt raiſe good Forts againſt theſe two Gates, as afterwards ſomething with the lateſt they were conſtrained to do.</p>
                  <p>But this Failure was nothing in compariſon of another far greater, and which coſt the whole Army very dear. For the beſieged making no manner of Sallies to hinder their Approaches, and ſeeming to be buried in a profound Quiet, not ſo much as bringing one Engine to the Walls for their Defence, they in appearance look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if they had loſt all their Courage and their Hope, ſo that it was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Imagination that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could not fail preſently to make themſelves Maſters of the Town: So that hereupon they took the Liberty to ramble up and down the Country,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> and to ſtraggle all over the Villages round about to make merry, and without any neceſſity to waſt that mighty plenty of proviſions with which that fertile Soil abounded; and, in ſhort, they neither kept Order nor Diſcipline in the Camp, partly by reaſon of the falſe opinion which poſſeſſed them, that this contemptible Enemy would ſurrender the Town without a Blow, but principally by the misfortune that both Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> and Prince <hi>Raymond</hi> were fallen ſick, which had like to have intirely ruined their Affairs.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1097</label> The Enemies quickly advertiſed by their Spies of this diſorder, failed not to make advantage of it; they began at laſt after ſo long a ſilence to make a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty noiſe with their Engines, and afterwards inſtantly to aſſail the Camp upon all Quarters, ſo that the beſiegers ſeemed now to be beſieged. Their Cavalry fallying at the Bridge-Gate, over-ran that Quarter which was beyond the River, cutting in pieces all thoſe whom they found diſperſed and without Arms, as if it had been in a time of perfect Peace: Nor was it poſſible for their Companions to ſuccour them, in regard that they muſt either by ſwimming or fording come to their Aſſiſtance, neither of which could quickly be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Others of them made Sallies either openly and in good Order, aſſaulting the Quarters which were negligently guarded, or by ſurprize creeping along the River ſide and the Mariſh among the Reeds, they fell upon ſuch as were idly walking or diverting themſelves in the Gardens and Orchards, as if they had not been in an Enemies Country. In this manner the unfortunate <hi>Alberon</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Mets,</hi> a young Prince of the Blood Imperial miſerably periſhed; for as he was walking with a Lady of great Quality in one of theſe Gardens he was ſurprized by the Infidels, who cut off his head, and carried the Lady Priſoner into the City, where after the barbarous Villains had committed all the Outrages imaginable againſt her Honor, they cut off her head alſo and threw them into <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Camp. After which the Beſiegers aſhamed to be ſo affronted by the miſtake of the Courage of their Enemies, began now to act after new Meaſures, and recalling their Ancient Vertue, to think of taking the City in good Earneſt.</p>
                  <p>They therefore began to attack it by main Force with all ſorts of Engines, and gave a general Aſſault with all the Vigor imaginable; but as the ſtrongeſt Engines were too feeble againſt thoſe Maſſy Walls, and that the unſhaken Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were defended by an Army which might in the open field have given Battle to the <hi>Cruſades;</hi> it was reſolved to attempt it by a long Siege, and the Regular way of Art; for this purpoſe they laid a Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Orontes,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe thoſe who had the Liberty to paſs by the Bridge Gate; they built Forts to block up the beſieged, and to empeach their frequent Sallies; and, in ſhort, nothing was omitted that might ſtraiten them of Proviſion, and at laſt oblige them by Famine to ſurrender the Town. But the Conſumption of Proviſions which ſo great an Army occaſioned, the continual Excurſions of the Turkiſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons who were about <hi>Antioch,</hi> who waſted all the Country, the frequent loſs of Convoys, and the Rigor of the following Winter almoſt famiſht the Beſiegers, ſo that at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Army had neither Forrage nor Proviſions; It is true that <hi>Bohemond</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> who were almoſt continually on horſeback, did what was poſſible to get ſubſiſtence, oftentimes beating the Enemy who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to hinder them. But as there was a general Deſolation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that there came nothing by Sea in that tempeſtuous and rough Seaſon; ſo though for the moſt part they returned loaden with glory for having beaten the <hi>Turks,</hi> yet they brought but a light ſtock of Proviſion for ſo great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which was not eaſily ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>This great evil ſo terrible of it ſelf and which encreaſed daily, was alſo accompanied with ſo many others as muſt in concluſion have reduced the Army to deſpair; the continual Rains had ſo dammaged the Tents that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers lay almoſt quite expoſed; moſt of the Horſes died, ſo that there were not many above a thouſand left in the whole Army. At the ſame time arrived the deplorable account of the Misfortune of <hi>Swenon</hi> the Son of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who coming to the Siege with fifteen hundred freſh Cavaliers all brave and choice men, was by <hi>Solyman</hi> ſurprized in a Valley and cut in pieces. Many daily deſerted, following the example of the Traitor <hi>Talin</hi> the Emperors Lieutenant, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go to ſolicit his Maſter for ſuccour, abandoned the Army; many alſo of the principal Officers of the Army withdrew, and among the reſt the ſtout <hi>William</hi> the Carpenter Vicount of <hi>Melun.</hi> And which is moſt ſurprizing, even <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit, he who was the forwardeſt of all others to take up the Croſs, was alſo one of the firſt who deſerted it, and this great Faſter, who by his voluntary auſterity by which he had gained ſo high a Reputation of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony making Profeſſion to eat neither bread nor fleſh, was not able to reſiſt

An example which gives us to underſtand, that there is rarely a ſolid Foundation for this outſide Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, eſpecially when it comes to make ſo great a Noiſe; and that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God Almighty permits it to be followed with remarkable humiliation, either to diſcover the falſeneſs and illuſion of it, if feigned, or to cure it of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being proud of it, the beſt of all that is good, if it be true; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the confuſion which <hi>Peter</hi> drew upon himſelf by ſo cowardly an Action was ſufficient to cure him of that diſtemper. For <hi>Tancred</hi> who foreſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence of this pernicious flight, perſued theſe two Deſerters, and brought them back to the Tent of his Uncle <hi>Bohemond,</hi> who there in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Princes ſeverely reproached them with their baſe Cowardize; but at the Importunate intreaties of <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great, whoſe Kinſman the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter had the honor to be, they were pardoned, though with this condition, that they ſhould publickly make Oath that they would accompliſh their Vow, and not abandon this Enterprize, till they had delivered the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, every day produced new misfortunes, and now the Peſtilence which is the uſual Attendant of Famine began to make a terrible Deſtruction in the Army: Whereupon the Biſhops had recourſe to extraordinary Prayers, and admirable Regulations were made, and ſevere Orders given out againſt the Vices and Diſorders which had ſlipt into the Camp, and which with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was apprehended were the Cauſes of God's diſpleaſure againſt them; nor was it long before the Supernatural Efficacy of this procedure became moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for from that time the Plague began to decreaſe, and Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> whoſe diſtemper ſeemed to be communicated to the whole Army beginning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to recover his Health, he by his preſence inſpired new life, Health, Vigor and Courage into the Souldiers. A great Succour of twenty eight thouſand Horſe who attempted to force the quarter of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> were defeated by this brave Prince and the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe;</hi> and, which is the Miracle, they had only Seven hundred Horſe divided into ſix ſquadrons, with which they engaged and vanquiſhed this great number of Enemies upon the Nineteenth day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> between the River and the Lake, where they had put themſelves in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that they might not be ſurrounded. After which they returned to the Camp loaden with the ſpoils of their Enemies, and that which they moſt wanted, a great number of Horſes. And as a Trophee of their Victory, they threw over the Walls a hundred of the Heads of the principal <hi>Turks,</hi> thereby alſo to puniſh the Inſolence of the Beſieged, who inſulted over the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a little before, by ſhewing them upon the Walls, one of the Standards which they had taken in a Sally wherein was painted the Image of the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the Ambaſſadors of the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt</hi> arrived in the Camp to treat of an Alliance with the Princes, to whom he promiſed to joyn his Forces againſt their Common Enemies; and not long after two Fleets from <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> arrived very Fortunately at the Port of St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> with all ſorts of Proviſions which were very welcome after a five-month-Siege; but this Arrival was the occaſion of a great Miſchief as well as of a great advantage. For ſo ſoon as the Arrival of theſe two Fleets was known in the Camp, the Souldiers ran thither in Shoals, every one with Precipitation, reſolving to purvey for themſelves ſuch things as they wanted. There was reaſon to fear that the Enemy would lay hold of this Opportunity and Diſorder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bohemond</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> who were to conduct the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ambaſſadors to the Port in order to their imbarquing, haſted with their Troops to convoy in their return, this great multitude of Souldiers, who were gone without any order, and without their Arms. And that which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended fell out accordingly; for they fell into an Ambuſcade of four thouſand of the Enemies who had ſecretly ſallied out of the Town by the Bridge-Gate. And meeting with theſe diſorderly Souldiers in the Plain loaden with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and without other Arms than their Swords, they fell in among them, and notwithſtanding all the Valour of Count <hi>Raimond</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tarren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> they could not ſtop the Rout but that the Souldiers fled towards the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64918:35"/>Mountains leaving all their Proviſions and a thouſand of their Companions dead upon the place.</p>

                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> who was immediately advertized of this Diſaſter by ſome who fled with the firſt, took a Party reſolving immediately to charge the Turks whom he doubted not with the Joy of their Victory and the Greedineſs of the Booty to find in ſufficient Diſorder; drawing out therefore four Batalions ſuſtained with all the Cavalry, at the head of whom were <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great, the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Bullen,</hi> he paſſed the Bridge of Boats, and marched directly towards the Enemies with all the Marks of Hope and Courage: in the way he joyned the two Princes whom he had given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for loſt, and who after they had unprofitably uſed their utmoſt Efforts to rally their Fugitives, had diſingaged themſelves very fortunately from the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Accien</hi> who had an account of this Victory, and who from one of the Towers of his Caſtle obſerved this great Movement of the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> began to be in pain for the return of his Men, he therefore commanded the greateſt part of his Army to ſally out to their Relief. He conducted them himſelf to the Gate, and giving order to have it ſhut after them, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the Souldiers; <hi>That after the advantages which their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had had againſt their Enemies, it would be a ſhame to them to think of Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to aſſure themſelves of a Retreat; that this was the time that they muſt think of nothing but Victory or Death, and that they ſhould never ſee this Gate opened to them, but after an intire Conqueſt of their Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide <hi>Godfrey</hi> who marched but ſlowly at the Head of his Troops, having underſtood by the haſty return of his Scouts, that the Conquerors who had joyned the Succours from the Town, drew near loaden with their Booty, drawing his Sword and turning to his Men, after he had caſt a fierce and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing look towards the Enemy, he cryed, <hi>Follow me, It is the Will of God.</hi> Giving them to underſtand by this action, that upon this occaſion they ſhould truſt to their Swords only without uſing either Lances or Arrows. Whereupon all the Souldiers in an inſtant drawing their Swords, and making a kind of Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of their Bucklers againſt the Arrows of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who running hither and thither inceſſantly diſcharged upon them, they marched gravely, neither with Precipitation nor Heavineſs, till they came up to the Enemies at Swords point, thereby rendring their Bows and Arrows uſeleſs. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> terrified with this confident March, which put them out of their way of ſighting, and took away the Service of their Bows, they preſently recoiled upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves who were come to relieve them, and being incumbred with the Spoils they had taken, were in no condition to reſiſt the Swords of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they did not much delight to combat but at a diſtance, ſo that the Fight was not very long; for after the firſt Squadrons of the Enemy were repulſed, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fell into the middle of them with their Infantry, and on all hands made a moſt horrible Slaughter of theſe miſerable Wretches, with the mighty Blows of the Sword; ſo that they were totally routed, ſome flying to the Mountains, others towards the City, not dreaming that the Gate was ſhut againſt them. Here it was that Deſpair and the fatal Neceſſity of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing or dying which <hi>Accien</hi> had denounced againſt them, made them renew the Combat in the view of the whole Town, which ran to the Walls and ſtood there as in an Amphitheatre to be Spectators and Witneſſes either of their ſhame in being vanquiſhed, or of their Glory in being Victors.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Godfrey</hi> after he was pretty well aſſured of the Victory, had diſingaged himſelf from the Combat, with a Deſign to prevent the Runaways getting into the Town by cutting off their Retreat, and therefore being got to a riſing Ground near the Bridge he flew like Lightning among his Enemies, who fled at full Speed, thinking he had been at their Heels, who was at their Head to ſtop their Cariere. Never was there ſeen any thing comparable to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that extraordinary and prodigious Force which Nature had beſtowed upon this Prince; there was not one Blow of his terrible Sword which did not carry a dreadful Death along with it; here he made a Head with the Cask that was on it roll off from the Shoulders; there a whole Arm with the Cimiter which it yet graſped; ſome he cleft down to the very Shoulders; others he cut
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64918:35"/>aſunder in the Middle; filling all with Horror, Blood and Terror,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> which way ſoever he turned himſelf, and at the ſame time the other Princes who purſued the Fugitives with their Swords at their Backs, finding them ſtopped by the Squadron of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> made a moſt dreadful Slaughter among them, or whileſt they indeavoured to ſave their Lives, made them loſe them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as dreadful; for they conſtrained them blindly to precipitate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Orontes,</hi> where the Soldiers diſpatched them with their Pikes, which the poor Wretches could no way eſcape but by Swimming. The Places adjacent reſounded with the lamentable Cries and the Tumult of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> dying either in the Field or in the River, which began to be diſcoloured with the Blood of the Slain, and the Noiſe was Ecchoed by thoſe who from the Walls ſaw the woeful Slaughter of their Companions, ſo that in concluſion <hi>Accien</hi> was obliged to open the Gate, to help thoſe who could to make their Eſcape by the Bridge into the Town.</p>
                  <p>It was upon this Occaſion that <hi>Godfrey</hi> performed an Action of which the whole Earth talks, as of a Prodigy of Strength and Valour, and which I ſhould not have adventured to have given a place to in this Hiſtory, if it were not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted both by all the Writers of that Age, and by the Teſtimony of ſo many Eye-Witneſſes of its Truth. One of the principal Captains of the Enemies, of a Stature much exceeding the common, tranſported with Fury to obſerve that <hi>Godfrey</hi> kill'd all that came within the reach of his terrible Sword at the entry of the Bridge, where he had poſted himſelf to obſtruct the Paſſage, and that the <hi>Turks</hi> to avoid his dreadful Blows, threw one another headlong into the River, he ran up to him foaming with Rage, with his Sword advanced in the Air, and with all his force diſcharged ſo terrible a Blow upon the Duke, that he ſplit his Shield in two pieces, which he had oppoſed to it, to ward it off his Head, when <hi>Godfrey</hi> raiſing himſelf upon his Stirrups, gave him ſuch a furious Reverſe, that his Sword falling upon his right Shoulder paſſed quite through his Breſt to his left ſide, and made that half of his Body tumble to the Ground, whileſt the other remaining in the Saddle, was carried by the Horſe, who was continually pricked by the Spurs which ſtuck in his Sides by the convulſive Motions of the dying remainder of the Body, quite through the Town, making there ſuch a fearful Spectacle as ſtruck Conſternation, Horror, and Deſpair, into the Hearts of the moſt reſolute and daring who beheld it. The Night now coming on, and the Defendants pouring whole Showers of Arrows from their Engines upon the Walls, hindred the further Purſuit of the Victory. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt ſomething above a thouſand Men in this memorable Day, but it is impoſſible to recount the Loſs which the <hi>Infidels</hi> ſuſtained, for beſides thoſe which were ſlain upon the Field of Battle, there were above five thouſand who loſt their Lives upon the Bridge and thereabout, and the Number of thoſe who were either drowned or ſlain in the River, was ſo great that they almoſt made a Damm with their dead Bodies; among the reſt, one of the Sons of <hi>Accien,</hi> and twelve of their Amirals or Emirs, which are their chief Nobility, periſhed in that fatal Day; and two days after there were found fifteen hundred Perſons of Quality, whom according to their Cuſtom they interred privately in the Night, near the Bridge, with their Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, their Arms, Habits, and ſome Gold and Silver, and other their moſt precious Ornaments.</p>
                  <p>After this great Victory, the Beſieged who were now more cloſely blocked up than ever, by the Forts which were raiſed near the two Gates which had been free, had totally loſt their Courage, if at the ſame time they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the News, that the Sultan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the moſt potent Monarch of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> was ſending a prodigious Army to their Relief, which did ſomething revive their fainting Hopes: And in truth, this Sultan being continually ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Soliman,</hi> and by <hi>Senſadole</hi> the Son of <hi>Accien,</hi> had ſent <hi>Corbagath</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Perſon in whom among all his Captains he repoſed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Confidence, with a formidable Army of two hundred thouſand Horſe, and an innumerable Multitude of Foot of all the Nations ſubject to his Empire; conſiſting in all of ſix hundred and fifty thouſand Men.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> paſſed over the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and advanced towards <hi>Antioch</hi> with the Sultans of <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had joyned their Troops with his Army, with an intention to attaque the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their Camp. This News which gave great Courage to the Beſieged, cauſed much Diſorder in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, ſo that many, and ſome of principal Note, deſpairing of their Safety daily deſerted, and among the reſt, the Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> was ſo terrified, that feigning himſelf Sick, he cauſed himſelf to be removed in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> whither he was followed by four thouſand of his Soldiers; this Action made it be feared that others following ſo pernicious an Example, the whole Army would be in danger of Disbanding. But as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened preſently after, by a pleaſant Frolique of Fortune, this which was dreaded as a mighty Miſchief, proved in the end a great Advantage, and this News which made the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> deſpair of taking <hi>Antioch,</hi> was the Occaſion that one Night, preſently after, it was taken in the manner which I am now going to relate.</p>
                  <p>There was a Perſon in <hi>Antioch,</hi> a Citizen of Quality, one <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> a Man of great Spirit, he was born of Chriſtian Parents, and had been one himſelf; but for the ſaving his Eſtate he pretended to turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> as did divers others in the fourteen years after the City came under the Dominion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> This <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had gained ſo much Eſteem and Credit among the <hi>Infidels,</hi> that notwithſtanding the Diſtruſt which they had of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> whom therefore they kept very low, not permitting them to exerciſe any Place of Truſt, or to bear Arms, yet <hi>Accien</hi> charmed with his good Qualities, and the Belief of his Fidelity, had honoured him with the Dignity of an <hi>Emir,</hi> intruſted him with the Guard of three Towers, made him his Secretary of State, and gave him a Place in his Council. This Man had a Son a ſprightly young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who at the beginning of the Siege was in a Sally taken Priſoner by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemond;</hi> that Prince who was no leſs Dextrous and Wiſe than Vailant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined his Priſoner, whoſe Countenance promiſed ſo fairly, found in his Soul a great Inclination to return to the Religion of his Anceſtors, and that he was ready to undertake any thing to deliver his Country from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Tyranny of the <hi>Turks:</hi> He therefore laid hold upon this propitious Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to gain the Father, who paſſionately loved this Son, and offered a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ranſom for his Redemption; for this purpoſe, when he had well aſſured himſelf of the young Gentleman, who ſecretly abjured the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and received Baptiſme, he freely ſent him back to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who was ſo tranſported with his Return, and the account he gave of the good Treatment which he had received from <hi>Bohemond,</hi> and the Wonders which were related to him of that Prince, that there was nothing which he did not reſolve to do, to give him aſſurance of his Acknowledgments, and to procure the honor of his Friendſhip. After this <hi>Bohemond</hi> failed not to maintain a ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him by the Aſſiſtance of his Son, who frequently went out of the Town into the Camp, under pretence of being a Spie, as divers others did, and he laboured ſo ſucceſsfully under the Favour of this Friendſhip which was made between them, that in concluſion <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> deſired nothing more ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than to reimbrace the Chriſtian Religion, and to deliver his Country.</p>
                  <p>But that which perfected this Affair, was a great Conference which the Prince had with <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> during the little Truce which was made after the Defeat at the Bridge-Gate; for after he had given him a thouſand Teſtimonies of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had for him, and the reaſon which he had to make his Fortune and a true Happineſs, he ſaid ſuch moving things to him upon this Subject, and ſo well managed his Spirit, by his Arguments, his Intreaties, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that he quickly perceived he had ſo intirely gained him, that he was now become abſolutely at his Devotion.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, after the Truce was broken by the perſidiouſneſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who in that time baſely murdered one of the principal <hi>Cruſades, Pyrrhus</hi> ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Bohemond, That having now fully conſidered of all things, he had taken his laſt Reſolution, which was, to be ready to ſerve him to the utmoſt; that for his own particular, it was not any ſort of Fear that he had to ſuffer in the common Ruine of the City, that moved him to Act as he did, ſince he was well aſſured that the</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64918:36"/>
                     <hi>would never be able to take it by Force;
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> but that it was the ardent Deſire which he had to return to the Chriſtian Religion, to deliver</hi> Antioch <hi>his Country from the Servitude and Oppreſſion of the</hi> Turks, <hi>and to give him ſome undeniable Effects of that Friendship which he might expect from him, which obliged him to follow his Advice, and wholy to throw himſelf upon his Word, in an Affair of that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, wherein he muſt hazard not only his Fortune and his Life, but that of his whole Family. But that it was but juſt, that in regard he had only entruſted him with the Secret, that he should give him Aſſurance before any thing should be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, that he should only depend upon him; And that therefore he was abſolutely reſolved that this should be one Condition, without which he would proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That whereas the other Princes had all the ſame Authority in the Army, they would yield the Principality of</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi> Bohemond, <hi>to whom only he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it, and from whom only he would expect the Accomplishment of his Promiſes. That upon theſe Terms he would put the three Towers, whereof he had the Command, into his Poſſeſſion, and by Conſequence the Town; That he would ſend his Son as a Hoſtage, to engage for the Truth of his Word; and that he deſired him ſingly to conſider that he had not a moments time to loſe, by reaſon of the Succours which were now at hand, and that it was abſolutely neceſſary for him to Act according to theſe Offers, or elſe to reſolve wholy to abandon the Deſign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether this <hi>Norman</hi> Prince, who was mighty Politick, had laid the Train in this manner, by which he was reſolved to accompliſh his Ends, and therefore made <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſpeak at this rate; or whether <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> himſelf found it effectually his clear Intereſt, to raiſe his own Fortunes by the greatneſs of his Friend, and therefore propoſed this as the only probable Expedient; moſt certain it is that <hi>Bohemond</hi> accepted the Condition with all his Heart, and that he was extreamly ſatisfied to ſee, that there was no poſſibility of taking <hi>Antioch,</hi> but by his ſingle Intereſt. He nevertheleſs diſſembled his Joy, that ſo his Deſign might ſucceed the better; and failed not the ſame day, at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, with a melancholy Air, to complain in theſe Terms of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition of Affairs, he ſaid, <hi>That thoſe Evils which the Army indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed were Inſupportable, which they daily Suffered, and which daily increaſed by that long Siege, which had now laſted ſeven Months without making any tolerable Advance, and which was yet worſe, that they were in danger ſhamefully to abandon the Siege, ſince there was no appearance that they ſhould take</hi> Antioch, <hi>neither by Force, which their Condition would not ſuffer them to attempt, nor by Starving them, ſince the ſo long talked of Succours could not now be at any great Diſtance. There remains therefore,</hi> added he very Inſinuatingly, <hi>nothing more to be done, but to try if there be any one amongſt us who before the Succours arrive, will endeavour to make himſelf Maſter of the Town, either by Surprize, or by Intelligence, and gaining ſome in the place by Money or Promiſes, or any other way, which his Mind can ſuggeſt to him as moſt probable. And in ſhort, that we may animate one another to this Enterprize, I am of Opinion, that for the publick Good, which every one of us ought to prefer before his private Intereſt, we ought all to promiſe, that if the Deſign ſucceeds, he ſhall have the Principality of</hi> Antioch <hi>for his Reward, who ſhall perform this Exploit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage the Army from this Siege which hath ſo long troubled it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is certainly nothing ſo clear-ſighted as Jealouſy, nothing that ſo ſoon diſcovers a Rival, be it in Love, or be it in Honor. And whatſoever Artifice there was in this Diſcourſe of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> theſe Princes, who beſides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion, for which they made this War, had alſo thoſe of their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their Advancement, eaſily penetrated into the Heart of the <hi>Tarentine,</hi> and making no queſtion by the manner of his Diſcourſe, but that he acted for himſelf, they all anſwered with ſome kind of Precipitation, <hi>That they were all Brothers, and all Equals, and that they would never permit that there ſhould be any Preference among thoſe who had equally ſerved with the others. That there was no manner of Juſtice to divide the Conqueſt, but to thoſe who had ſhared in the Pains and Danger, and that tho</hi> Antioch <hi>was to have but one Maſter, yet it muſt be Lot that muſt chuſe him, and it was to Fortune only and her Power, that the Principality of</hi> Antioch <hi>was to be owing.</hi>

                     <hi>Bohemond</hi> ſeeming not to take the leaſt Notice that this Blow was levelled at him, only ſmiled at the Diſcourſe, without making any Reply, well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that whether they would or not, Neceſſity without his Help would man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this Affair, in which he could not now move but to his Diſadvantage; and ſo it happened, for at the ſame time News was brought them, by thoſe who were ſent to make Diſcovery, that the Enemy approached with a moſt formidable Power. Whereupon they went again to the Council, where ſome were of Opinion that they ſhould march out and meet the Enemy, with the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, others were for leaving only ſo many as might guard the Trenches in the Camp, and to lead the reſt to Battle: But <hi>Bohemond</hi> made it appear on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that neither the one nor the other of theſe Propoſitions were practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For in doing the firſt they raiſed the Siege, and then the Town would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be Relieved; that in following the ſecond, they muſt needs run the Hazzard of being beaten, ſince their whole Army, leſſened by above half, was ſcarce able to oppoſe the Forces of the City alone. Now theſe things being ſo clear, and that there was no Expedient ſo proper to draw the Army out of ſo preſſing and manifeſt a Danger, all the Princes except Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> found it more agreeable to Reaſon, that <hi>Bohemond</hi> if he could gain it, ſhould be Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Antioch,</hi> than that they ſhould all be affronted by loſing it after ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Siege. They therefore conſented, that provided he took the City, let the Way be what it would, every one ſhould relinquiſh their Intereſt to him, with condition that the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor failed in his part of the Agreement made with him. The Prince of <hi>Tarentum</hi> had now all that he could wiſh, for <hi>Alexis</hi> had already broke his Word a thouſand times, ſo that inſtantly he ſent to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to acquaint him that he was ready to put the Matter in Execution according to thoſe Meaſures which he ſhould himſelf preſcribe, and to deſire him to let him know as ſoon as it was poſſible. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> preſently ſent him an Anſwer, by his Son, who was to be the Hoſtage, with the Order which was to be obſerved, which after it had been Communicated to the Princes, was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in this manner.</p>
                  <p>He gave out Orders through every Quarter of the Camp, that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be ready to march the Morning following, being the third day of <hi>June,</hi> and accordingly at high Noon he marched at the Head of the commanded Party with Trumpets ſounding, that ſo the Beſieged taking Notice of them, might ſuppoſe they were going upon ſome Deſign abroad, and be the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of any thing intended againſt them at home; but towards the Evening, having taken a long Circuit behind the Mountains towards the South, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Head, and taking his March Weſtward to the left Hand, he ſtopped in a Valley a little diſtance from the Weſtern Gate, where ſtood one of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which was to be put into his Hands: From thence he ſent ſixty of the moſt reſolute Soldiers with a Ladder of Ropes, of the length which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had directed. But as a certain <hi>Lombard,</hi> who had the Signal which was to ſhew that <hi>Bohemond</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> were met, was about to give it, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Accident which had like to have loſt all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> who were ever jealous of the <hi>Christians,</hi> had received Advice that there was ſome Treachery hatching in the Town, and that in particular there was ſome Reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Pyrrhus: Accien</hi> who was reſolved to clear the Matter, ſent for him, as was cuſtomary, to the Council, where this matter was under Debate, and asked his Advice, to ſee whether he would change his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſo betray his Guilt of ſuch a Deſign. But this cunning Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Intention of the <hi>Turk,</hi> without the leaſt Heſitation or mark of Aſtoniſhment replied briskly, That nothing ought to be neglected upon ſuch an Occaſion, and that he had thought of a moſt eaſy and certain Expedient to hinder ſo great a Miſchief. For, ſaid he, with the greateſt Aſſurance imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, there needs no more but to change the Captains who command at the Gates and in the Towers, to break all the Meaſures of thoſe who may have entertained any Intelligence with the Enemies. This Expedient which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo proper, made them baniſh the Suſpition which they had entertained of him, and which they had no poſitive Evidence to ſupport; but conſidering
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64918:37"/>that ſuch a Change could not be made on the ſuddain,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, the Execution of it was deferred till the next Morning, and then it was reſolved by this means to cure the Diſtruſts which they had of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thereby to quiet the Fears of the People; however Orders were given to thoſe who went the Round that Night, to acquit themſelves of their Charge with all the Care and Circumſpection that was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Now as the <hi>Lombard</hi> began to ſpeak to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the Captain who walked the Round in that Quarter came by, with one carrying a Lanthorn before him; and without doubt all had been diſcovered, if <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> who ſaw him coming, had not inſtantly acquainted the Soldiers with it, and ordered them to fall flat upon their Bellies. After which the Round, who found all in good Order, being paſſed by, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> who had ſo luckily eſcaped two ſuch eminent Dangers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perceived the Sign of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> threw down a Cord by which he drew up the Ladder, which he faſtened to one of the Battlements of the Tower: The ſixty Soldiers being now gotten up, <hi>Bohemond</hi> who was advertiſed by the <hi>Lombard</hi> that all was their own, ran with the reſt, who mounted with ſo much heat, and in ſuch a Throng, that the Ladder being overcharged pulled down the Battlement to which it was tied, which with its Fall cruſhed ſome of the Soldiers; but this did not hinder, but that the Ladder being well faſtened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain others mounted it with an equal Ardor; and whileſt ſome of them made themſelves Maſters of the Towers, killing all the <hi>Turks</hi> which they met, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers broke open a Sally-Port by which <hi>Bohemond</hi> entred, followed by the reſt of his Troops, who ſeizing upon the Gates, by break of day the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was without Reſiſtance got into the City, where <hi>Bohemond,</hi> as it were, to take Poſſeſſion, had cauſed his Standard to be planted.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the horrible Conſequences of this Surprize, which being favoured by a great Wind, the ſleeping <hi>Turks</hi> had ſcarcely heard the Noiſe which the Victorious Army made in their Entry. All went down indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently which came in their way in that terrible Tumult, the very Brother of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was ſlain among the reſt, being unknown, and which was moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by the Hand of his Brother <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tyre</hi> writes, either becauſe he had diſcovered the Deſign, or becauſe he oppoſed it; but this is contrary to the poſitive Evidence of all thoſe who were preſent, who affirm that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was moſt ſenſibly touched with this Misfortune, which was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be attributed to Chance; however <hi>Bohemond</hi> did what he could to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, and gave order for the Preſervation of his Family, and of all the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who to diſtinguiſh themſelves, came before the Conquerors ſinging the Prayers of the Church. The greateſt part of the <hi>Turks</hi> were killed either in the Houſes, or in the Streets, indeavouring either to defend themſelves by ſighting, or ſave their Lives by flying: Few there were who ſaved themſelves, all the Gates being either ſhut or poſſeſſed by the <hi>Cruſades;</hi> and at the laſt thoſe who indeavoured to eſcape over the Walls, or who to fly into the Caſtle, were without Mercy put to the Sword. The unfortunate <hi>Accien,</hi> whether it were that his Fear had deſtroyed his Judgment, or that he thought thereby to haſten the Relief, or that he feared there was the ſame Treachery in the Caſtle, fled out by the Gate of the Plain in a Diſguiſe, and having hid himſelf in a little Hut, he was diſcovered by ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> and by them ſlain, and his Head preſented to <hi>Bohemond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this the Soldiers fell to Plunder, and by that piece of Witchcraft of good Fortune, which makes Men in Proſperity too commonly to forget God, they plunged themſelves headlong into all manner of Debauches, as it were to make a Recompence to thoſe great Evils they had ſuffered by a long Siege by committing greator: But God that he might puniſh this brutiſh Ingratitude, permitted them to fall into greater and more inſupportable than any they had yet indured; for within three or four days after the Town was taken, <hi>Corbagath</hi> arriving with his Army, and having put what Men he thought good into the Caſtle, to attaque the Retrenchments of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and having poſſeſſed all the Avenues, and made himſelf Maſter of all the Forts which the <hi>Cruſades</hi> had raiſed, he Incamped in the Plain between the <hi>Orontes</hi> and the Mountains, and beſieged the City much more cloſely than it was before. So that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64918:38"/>but little Proviſion in the Town after ſo long a Siege,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> and the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too little after it was taken to lay in more, and impoſſible to get any into the Town, the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army being there ſhut up, the Famine in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time was ſo great, that the ordinary ſort of Proviſion being ſpent, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were reduced to the moſt deplorable Extremities that are upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in any Hiſtory, either Sacred or Profain. Inſomuch that many did every Night deſert, and ran away to the Enemies, or climbing over the Rocks indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get to the Ships which lay in the Port St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> as did among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt Quality, <hi>Alberic</hi> and his Brother <hi>William de Grandmenil,</hi> who had Married the Siſter of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> the Vicount <hi>de Melun,</hi> that famous <hi>William</hi> the Carpenter, who thought that Famine was a ſufficient Diſpenſation for the Oath which he had taken to deſert no more. The Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> feigning himſelf Sick, was gone two days before the Town was taken, and joyning himſelf with them, they all together went to the Camp of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was coming, or at leaſt pretended ſo, to joyn the <hi>Cruſades;</hi> and there they made all appear ſo deſperate to cover their own ignomimous Cowardice, that that treacherous Prince, who was before reſolved to do nothing, was overjoyed to meet with ſo fair a Pretence to alter his Courſe and march back again to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In ſhort, Matters went ſo very far, that the Soldiers half mad with Deſpair, abandoned all ſort of Care of their own Defence, ſo that Prince <hi>Bohemond,</hi> who Commanded in the Town, was forced to ſet Fire to their Houſes, to force them out, and put them upon Action.</p>
                  <p>Things being reduced to this deplorable Extremity, it is ſtrange what Power Religion hath upon the Spirits of Men, and how in a Moment it will raiſe them after once it becomes Maſter by the power of a ſtrong Perſwaſion; for two Prieſts, one called <hi>Stephen,</hi> the other <hi>Peter Bartholomew,</hi> both of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves before the Princes to acquit themſelves of a Commiſſion, which they aſſured them they had received from Heaven. The firſt ſaid, That at his Prayers he had ſeen Jeſus Chriſt, who after he had complained of the Ingratitude and horrible Crimes of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> being in the end inclined by the Intreaties of his Mother, he was come to him, and commanded him to let them know, that if they would for the future amend and turn from their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ways, he would ſend them Succour within five Days. The ſecond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That St. <hi>Andrew</hi> had ſhewed him within the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Place where they might find the Iron of the Spear that pierced the Side of our Lord, and that he had aſſured him that this Holy Iron ſhould be a certain Pledge of the approaching Deliverance of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> provided they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their Sins; and both the one and the other offered themſelves to the Flames to confirm the Truth of what they had declared. The Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> who was a Perſon of a clear Inſight, did not believe theſe kind of Viſions, which he knew were generally the Effects of Forgery or Illuſion, but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that he might not ſeem to neglect any thing that might be true, and which however, might be of ſome Service to them, he obliged the Prieſts to Swear upon the Holy Evangeliſts, that what they ſaid was true, being unwilling to have Recourſe to thoſe other Proofs, which had nothing in them of the Spirit of the Church, and not thinking it agreeable to Religion, by ſuch Methods to tempt Providence. After which going to the Place which the Prieſt directed, they there found the top of a Spear, ſo that the whole Army was ſo perſwaded of the Truth of theſe Viſions, and that Relique, that no body durſt preſume to make any Doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>However, the Belief did not laſt always, for ſome eight or nine Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they were at the Siege of a certain Town, where they had recourſe to this Relique, which was moſt curiouſly preſerved by Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> a Prieſt who was the Domeſtick Chaplain of the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and a knowing Man, maintained publickly that it was a Counterfeit, that the true Spear had been long ago carried to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that the Provencals had put this in the Place where it was found, only on purpoſe to pleaſe their Earl. Upon which the whole Army was divided, the Prieſt of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that he was ready to prove the Truth of his Revelation, by paſſing the Trial of the Fire, which in Concluſion the Biſhops permitted him to do. After
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64918:38"/>a Faſt of three Days, therefore, a great Fire was made,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> upon which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a Solemn Benediction, after which the Provencal taking the Iron of the Spear in his Hand, paſſed, excepting his Shirt, quite Naked through it, but for all the haſt that he could make over that huge Pile, in the ſight of the Army, who were ſcarce able to indure the Heat at a Diſtance, the poor Prieſt, who was a ſilly Man, and credulous of his Revelation, did not find the Succeſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Expectation. It is true he came out from the midſt of the Flames, but ſo Roaſted without, and Scorched within, by the Vapor of the Fire which he ſucked in with his Breath, that within twelve days he died in moſt exquiſite Torments. So that there was no longer that Reverence given to this Iron as was before, although Count <hi>Raymond</hi> would by no means be perſwaded to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of his Devotion towards this Relique, which for all this he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be Falſe; not thinking this Accident of the Prieſt, which went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too high, was a ſufficient Argument to prove the Falſity of the Viſion, For God, he ſaid, was not obliged to confirm by Miracles, what he was pleaſed to reveal to Men. But however, the Belief which was ſo firm while they were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that this was the real Spear which was Conſecrated by the Blood of Chriſt Jeſus, found a moſt admirable Effect upon the Spirits of the whole Army, who not doubting now in the leaſt of the Protection of God, and a moſt aſſured Victory, moſt eagerly demanded to be led to the Combat.</p>
                  <p>The Princes, who thought it very convenient to make uſe of this Heat, ſent <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite with an Interpreter to <hi>Corbagath,</hi> to offer him the Combat either Man to Man, between him and one of the Princes, or himſelf, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of choſen Soldiers of one ſide and the other, or in ſhort, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Battle, that ſo they might quickly determine the Quarrel between them: And in the mean time every one applied himſelf to the Work of Repentance, and with fervent Prayers to implore the Heavenly Aid from God, who had promiſed it upon thoſe Conditions. The Anſwer which <hi>Corbagath</hi> returned, was in theſe haughty Terms, That it was not for the Vanquiſhed to preſcribe Laws to the Victor, That it could not be long before he ſhould have them with Halters about their Necks, and that it would be in his Power to determine their Deſtiny, and by what kind of Death they were to Dye. <hi>Peter</hi> having made his Report to the Princes, they only acquainted the Soldiers that they muſt Fight, and that therefore they ſhould be ready to march againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the next day, which was the twenty eighth of <hi>June,</hi> being the Eve of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> This Order was received with a marvellous Chearfulneſs, every one prepared his Arms, and fell to his Devotions, the Biſhops and Prieſts Adminiſtred the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt all that Night, to the Principal Officers and the greateſt part of the Soldiers. Upon break of Day the Army, which by the nine Months Siege of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was reduced to leſs than one half, iſſued out by the Bridge-Gate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſix great Batallions, which followed one another, every one ſuſtained by a very ſmall Squadron of Cavalry, for that the greateſt part of the Horſes were dead and eaten by their Maſters during the extream Famine, and who this day were therefore conſtrained to ſerve on Foot. <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> commanded the firſt Body, the great Standard of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army being carried before him. One ſhall not find in all the fabulous Hiſtories of the feigned Heroes, any thing comparable to the Actions of this brave Prince upon this Occaſion; he was ſo Meagre and Weak by reaſon of the extream Famine which he had indured in the Siege, that he was ſcarce able to ſupport himſelf, inſomuch that he was requeſted by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes to ſtay with thoſe who were left to guard the Retrenchments which were made againſt the Caſtle. <hi>If it ſhall pleaſe God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe ſo fair an Occaſion of dying Gloriouſly for the ſake of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I will this day Fight at the Head of the Army; and I ſhall eſteem myſelf extraordinary Happy to be of the number of thoſe, who, by a Death precious in the Sight of God, and full of Glory in the Sight of Men, ſhall gain the glorious Crown of Martyrdom.</hi> In ſhort, he was the firſt that marched out of the Town, and who gave the firſt happy Preſage of the Victory, by cutting in pieces two thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> who were advanced out of the Fort to hinder the Sally. Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> led the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64918:39"/>ſecond Brigade compoſed of <hi>Lorrainers</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> The Duke of <hi>Normands</hi> followed after him with his Body. After him the Biſhop of <hi>Pavia</hi> with his Troops which were increaſed by a part of Count <hi>Raymond</hi>'s, who being ſick, remained in the Town with thoſe who kept the Guard againſt the Caſtle. <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> led the fifth Batallion, and the ſixth was conducted by <hi>Bohemond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was little need of ſaying any thing to inſpire the Soldiers with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, who were already prepoſſeſſed with ſo advantagious Imaginations of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Victory. A little pleaſant Dew which fell upon them as they marched out, increaſed their Belief, and conſirmed them in an Opinion that God had ſent it for their Refreſhment, and to give them an Increaſe of Strength. And in effect, whether there was any thing extraordinary in it at this time, or that their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination impregnated with the favourable Viſions which had been publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, acted more powerfully upon their Bodies, they felt themſelves ſtrengthened in ſuch a ſtrange manner, that they began to ſing, and with a mighty loud Voice to cry, <hi>It is the Will of God, it is the Will of God,</hi> and made no manner of Scruple but that they were going to a moſt aſſured Victory. So ſoon as all the Battalions were drawn out, they marched Weſtward, to that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the Mountains abutted upon the River, to the end, that having them upon their Backs they might not be ſurrounded by the mighty number of their Enemies; after which making a half turn to the left, towards the North, where the Mountains make a kind of Semicircle, they divided every Batalion into two, thereby forming twelve, which were ranged in two Lines extending a great length, thereby to poſſeſs all the ſpace between the Mountains and the <hi>Orontes. Hugh</hi> the Great, the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> had the left hand towards the Mountain which covered them; <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> was on the Right, extending himſelf to the very River, having <hi>Euſtace</hi> his Brother to ſuſtain him, together with the Earls of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Toul, Baldwin de Bourg, Renaud de Beauvais, Valon de Chaumont, Erard du Puiſet,</hi> and <hi>Tancred</hi> with his Brigade. The Biſhop of <hi>Pavia</hi> was in the middle, having the main Body of the Battle, with the Troops of the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> which in his Abſence were Commanded by the Earls of <hi>Die</hi> and <hi>Rouſillon, William de Montpellier, Gaſton de Foix</hi> Prince of <hi>Bearne, Amaneu d' Albret, Raymond</hi> Viſcount of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, Raimbaud</hi> Earl of <hi>Orange,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Viſcount <hi>de Caſtellane. Raymond de Agiles,</hi> Canon of <hi>Pavia,</hi> writes in his Hiſtory, that he carried the Holy Spear before his Biſhop, who altho he was Armed for his own Safety, yet fought no other way than by his Exhortations, by his Voice and Geſture animating the Army, in ſhewing them the Sacred Steel. He alſo adds, that by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Wonder, which ought to be attributed to the Faith which theſe Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had in Chriſt Jeſus, whom they honoured in this Spear, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was Conſecrated by his Blood, not one Man of thoſe who fought in that Body, received any Wound in this terrible Day. <hi>Bohemond</hi> Commanded the Body of Reſerves, Compoſed of his Batallion, which was the ſtrongeſt of them all, there being divers other Troops added to his, to the intent that he might ſend Succor to any of the reſt which might be too hard preſſed by the Enemy. One part of the Clergy which came out of the City in Proceſſion at the Head of the Army, was placed in his Quarter, to implore the Aid of Heaven during the Combat, the other which were barefooted upon the Walls, diſplayed the Croſs and the Enſigns towards the Army, continually giving them their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and with grievous Groans accompanied with the lamentable Cries of the Women and Children who followed them, begging the Almighty Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God againſt the wicked Enemies of his moſt Holy Name.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Corbagath,</hi> who had ſo mightily miſtaken the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was ingaged in a Game at Cheſs, when he was informed by a Signal from the Caſtle that they were iſſued out of the Town, and finding, contrary to his Opinion, that they made Head that way, with an intention to ſight him, he immediately gave out all neceſſary Orders for the receiving of them. For he inſtantly ſent <hi>Soliman</hi> the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with him of <hi>Alepo,</hi> and a brave <hi>Turk,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Karieth,</hi> with two great Bodies of Cavalry and Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to go round about the Mountain upon the right Hand, to fall upon the Rere of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the way of the Sea-Coaſt. But the Princes perceiving
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64918:39"/>it ſent a great Detachment compoſed of ſeveral Troops drawn from the two Wings, under the Command of <hi>Renaud</hi> Earl of <hi>Toul,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1098</label> to ſtop thoſe who might attack them on that Quarter during the Combat; to be ſhort, he ranged his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my partly upon the Hills which he poſſeſſed with his Right Wing commanded by the <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and partly upon the Plain which in that place inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it ſelf, giving a very good Scope to extend his Batallion which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Lieutenant; the Left Wing where he had placed his beſt Troops to oppoſe thoſe of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> was conducted by <hi>Bulgadis</hi> the Son of <hi>Accien,</hi> and <hi>Balduc</hi> Sultan of <hi>Samoſatia;</hi> for he thought that theſe two <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Princes, one of which had loſt his Father, and the other his Eſtate, would be animated more than any of the reſt to avenge their particular Loſſes by ſighting more vigorouſly in the Common Cauſe. As for himſelf, whether it were that his Courage failed him at that time, or that he was ſurprized and aſtoniſhed with the Prediction of his Mother an old Sorcereſs of above an hundred years of Age, who to diſſuade him from this War, had informed him ſome time before, that it was written in the Stars that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be victorious; he retired with a very puiſſant Body to an Eminence which was upon the left of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, under Pretext that from thence he might beſt be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whither to ſend his Orders and neceſſary Succours upon all occaſions: But in his ill Humour wherein he was to ſee the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in ſo different a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from what he believed, and who by their poſſeſſing in the manner of their drawing up the whole Plain, appeared to be far more numerous than in Reality they were, he cauſed the head of a Deſerter a <hi>Renegade</hi> to be out off, for that he had aſſured him that almoſt all the <hi>Cruſades</hi> were dead with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and that thoſe who remained not being able to carry their Arms, would never come out of the Town but to ſly away.</p>

However he did moſt bravely ſuſtain the furious Shock of ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till ſuch time as joyning Artifice with Force, they took from him by a new Stratagem, the Means either to attack them or defend himſelf. For <hi>Soliman</hi> who had obſerved that there was abundance of Hay upon the Plain, had cauſed his People to ſet it on Fire, which preſently raiſed ſuch a horrible thick Cloud intermingled with Flame and Smoak, that being carried by a ſtrong Weſt Wind upon the Faces of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it covered their Enemies, who all the while poured down Showers of Mortal Arrows among them through the Cloud of Smoak; this put them into great Diſorder, the Horſe being neither able to advance through the Fire and Smoak, nor to indure the inceſſant galling of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arrows whileſt they ſtood; ſo that they carried their Riders among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and the Foot who could not retreat ſo faſt, remained expoſed to the Fury of the Enemies. There were not however above three hundred Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſlain, but all the reſt were either taken or diſperſed, for <hi>Soliman</hi> did not follow the Purſuit, but according to his firſt Intention advanced to fall upon the Rere of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> whom the ſtout <hi>Turk Karieth</hi> with the <hi>Sultans</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepo</hi> who had now alſo entred the Plain, had already charged upon the Flank. This Valiant Prince upon this occaſion did all that could poſſibly be expected from the Courage or Conduct of the Greateſt Man in the World; but after all it was impoſſible he ſhould long be able to reſiſt ſo many Enemies as did ſurround him, if the Succours which he had deſired did not arrive more ſeaſonably. <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great was the firſt that came in to his Aſſiſtance, and preſently obſerving that the terrible <hi>Turk Karieth</hi> did the greateſt Execution and encouraged others by his Example, he made one blow, which ought to render the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this great Prince a Son of <hi>France,</hi> Immortal; and in Truth our own Hiſtorians in my opinion have not done him all the Juſtice which is his due, and which Hiſtory never refuſed to the meaneſt Souldier who behaved himſelf in like manner upon ſuch an occaſion. For marking out this <hi>Barbarian</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom he was encouraging, and puſhing forwards againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> crying to them with a loud Voice to fall on, he ran upon him with his Lance couched, and hitting him between the Curiaſs and the Cask, it paſſed croſs his Wind-pipe, and cutting off one Paſſage of that furious Voice which made ſuch a Horrid Noiſe, opened two others by which his Blood and his Life flowed out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Eudas de Baugeny</hi> who carried the Princes Colours, fell at the ſame time by the Stroak of a Poiſoned Arrow; but <hi>William de Beleme</hi> the Princes Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, animated by the Example of his Maſter, threw himſelf into the Throng of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who endeavoured to take it, and killing all that oppoſed him, he recovered it all covered with their Blood, and ſhewed it to the <hi>Cruſades</hi> in that Condition, being of the ſame Colour with thoſe Croſſes which they wore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> who loved this Prince <hi>Hugh</hi> with a mighty Tenderneſs, and who was reciprocally beloved by him; and <hi>Tancred</hi> whom the Danger wherein he ſaw his Uncle rendred furious, being in this time come in with their Troops, the Combat was renewed with more Fury than before; but it laſted not long, by reaſon that the Enemies utterly unable to ſuſtain the Force of ſo many Valiant Princes who were rejoyned againſt them, and who being come up to the Throng rendred their Bows uſeleſs, and their Artificial Fires vain, they now fled like the Smoak towards the Mountains, leaving in the Plain new Mountains raiſed by the Heaps of their ſlain Companions. The Princes immediately fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing about, without offering to purſue them, returned to their own Party, who were ſtill hotly diſputing with thoſe to whom this Diverſion had given new Courage; but that Courage was quickly cooled by the Knowledge which the Return of the Princes gave them of the defeat of their Companions; and they who before were not able to reſiſt them, could leſs do it now that they returned Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and reinforced by the Troops of Earl <hi>Renaud</hi> and <hi>Bohemond</hi> to perfect and finiſh the Victory.

                  <p>There was between the Place of Battle and the Enemies Camp a little Valley divided by a ſmall Rivulet which made the Paſſage very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; now the <hi>Turks</hi> who made more haſt than the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> having paſſed it ſome time before them, had the Leaſure to rally upon the Mountain, where with their broken Troops they formed a little kind of a new Army, hoping thereby to diſcourage ſome and ſurprize others which they thought would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in Diſorder. But <hi>Hugh</hi> the Great with his <hi>French</hi>-Men who ſtuck cloſely to him, having firſt paſſed the Valley charged them ſo Home, that <hi>Tancred</hi> and the reſt of the Princes which followed him being now come up, before they could recover the Diſorder of that brisk Charge, cut them all in pieces except a few, who repenting that they had ſtaid ſo long, found no ſmall trouble to regain the Advantage which their firſt ſlight had given them.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Corbagath</hi> who hitherto had not quitted the riſing Ground from whence he had with ſufficient Cowardize beheld the Combat, without taking the leaſt ſhare in it, ſeeing that all was loſt, fled at full Speed towards the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> every Hour taking freſh Horſes, and never looking behind him till he was got to the further ſide of that mighty River. As for the reſt, the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were ſo extreamly weary with fighting and with killing, that the Fugitives had a great advantage to eſcape, for there were none that purſued them except <hi>Tancred,</hi> who gave them chace for about two Leagues, till the coming on of the Night obliged him to return.</p>
                  <p>The Enemies loſt in this Battle one hundred thouſand Horſe, and ſo great a Number of Foot that it was not poſſible to compute them, and which was moſt remarkable, this mighty Victory did not coſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> above four thouſand Men; and to comfort them for this inconſiderable loſs, they took the Camp of the <hi>Infidels</hi> which was full of ineſtimable Riches; which did ſo reeſtabliſh the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that not only the Princes and Lords, but even the meaneſt Soldiers who had been reduced to the extremity of Miſery and Poverty, found themſelves in much a better Condition, and beyond Compariſon far more Rich than they were before they undertook this Voyage; and that which compleated the Joy was, that the <hi>Emir</hi> to whom <hi>Corbagath</hi> had intruſted the Guard of the Caſtle, inſtantly ſurrendred it, and with three hundred of his Men turned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the reſt having Liberty to retire whither they pleaſed. Thus was <hi>Antioch</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and preſerved by the moſt Memorable Exploits of War which ever were performed, and which I thought my ſelf obliged to recount with all its Cicum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to the End, that conſidering the Faults which the <hi>Cruſades</hi> committed, and the fearful Extremities to which they were reduced both during the Siege and afterwards, the Reader may be ſatisfied that God who puniſhes the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men by his Juſtice, and pardons them in his Mercy, was the only ſupport of this Enterprize, which in all Humane Probability muſt otherwiſe have been moſt unfortunate; ſo much doth it concern mighty Princes who make great Wars, to make it the Principal Maxime of their Policy, to gain Almighty God to be of their Party, and that by returning to him with a true Converſion of their Hearts, he may give Proſperity and Succeſs to their Arms, without which they muſt expect always to have him for their moſt Dreadful Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>

And in Truth there never was any Ambaſſage that proved more unfortunate. The Earl of <hi>Henault</hi> periſhed in the Way, and it was never preciſely known what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him nor what was become of him, though there was a currant Report, that he was either taken Priſoner or murdered by the <hi>Greek</hi> Soldiers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Nice. Hugh</hi> the Great after he had treated with the Emperor, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and whether he had taken ſome particular Diſguſt againſt ſome of the Princes, or that the Diviſions which he foreſaw Ambition would produce among them made him deſpair of any good Succeſs of the Voyage, or that ſome particular reaſon of Importance obliged him to return to <hi>France;</hi> it is certain that he returned from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in ſo abrupt a manner, that it hath given occaſion to ſome of the Writers of that Time to ſpeak not very favourably of his departure. And for the Emperor <hi>Alexis,</hi> as he knew very well that the Princes who had not at all flattered him in their Ambaſſage, were in no ſort ſatisfied of his Honeſty or good Conduct, he was far enough from going to <hi>Antioch;</hi> for he was too cunning and politick not to govern himſelf by that Maxime, <hi>That one ought alway to diſtruſt thoſe whom they have abuſed; eſpecially when they have diſcovered the Abuſe which hath been put upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after all this, the Joy of having thus gloriouſly triumphed over the whole Force of the Sultan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was mightily damped by the loſs of that great and good Prelate <hi>Aymar de Monteil</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Pavia;</hi> who ſhortly after falling ſick with his great Fatigues, died the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the infinite Trouble and Sorrow of all ſort of People to whom he was for his incomparable Qualities deſervedly dear; and indeed never were there ſeen greater Marks of Eſteem, Tenderneſs and Grief, than thoſe which the Princes, Soldiers and People gave upon this mournful Occaſion. Nor was it long before it appeared by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which happened among the Princes to the hazzarding the loſs of all, that he was the very Soul of this great Body, who by his Wiſdom and Preſence kept the different and jarring Humours in an equal Poiſe and Temperament. For no ſooner were the Princes who had ſeparated during the Summer, reaſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>November</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> according to Agreement to march together to the Conqueſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that <hi>Bohemond</hi> proteſted openly, that he would not move one ſtep except the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> put the Bridge-Gate Fortreſs into his Hands, and one of the Palaces of <hi>Accien</hi> which he alſo kept. The Earl, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs little to the Purpoſe, alledged the Promiſe made to the Emperor, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that for his part he was alſo reſolved not to ſtir till <hi>Bohemond</hi> ſurrendred to him the Caſtle which he had in <hi>Antioch.</hi> There was a great deal of Trouble at the laſt to gain ſo far upon them, as to condeſcend that leſt it might retard the Voyage, they ſhould remit their Differences to the Determination of the Princes after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But this forced Accord indured not long; for theſe two Princes, who were advanced with the firſt with their Troops, beſieged and took by Aſſault the great and ſtrong City of <hi>Marra,</hi> ſome two or three days March diſtant from <hi>Antioch</hi> towards <hi>Apamia.</hi> It is impoſſible to deſcribe the Heat which tranſported the Soldiers upon this occaſion, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Town without expecting the Command of the Generals; for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſupport the Inſolence, the Sacriledges and brutiſh Impiety of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who to deſpite them did a thouſand Indignities to the Croſs which they had planted upon their Walls, the Soldiers ran of their own accord to the Aſſault with ſo much Heat, Courage, and indeed Fury, that undermining the Walls and Towers, plying the Engines, and clapping up ſcaling Ladders on all Parts at the ſame time, they vanquiſhed the <hi>Infidels</hi> notwithſtanding their

                  <p>One day going out upon a Party as he frequently did, he heard the dreadful roaring of a Lyon, which ſeemed rather to be a crying out by reaſon of ſome Miſhap that he was fallen into, than in following his Prey to devour it; the Bold <hi>Geoffry</hi> who by the Movement of his natural Generoſity, always went without a Moments Deliberation the Way that Danger led him, not withſtanding the Oppoſition of his Companions who would have ſtaid him, broak away towards the next Wood, and ran directly to the Place where he heard the Roaring; there he ſaw a horrible Serpent of prodigious Magnitude, who having wound himſelf about the Legs of a Lyon had put him out of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of defending himſelf, and that he darted redoubled Blows with his Tongue to kill him with his Poyſon. He was touched with the Danger of the Lyon, and without thinking that in delivering him, he muſt give him the Liberty to fall upon himſelf, he ſtruck the Serpent ſuch a Blow with his Sword, that he killed him without hurting the Lyon, and after that cut the Wreaths of the Serpent with which he was entangled; ſo ſoon as the poor Animal ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Liberty, he came to acknowledge the Kindneſs, and in the moſt expreſſive manner, and with the greateſt Submiſſion to render Thanks to his Deliverer; for he couched himſelf down and licked his Feet, and after that binding himſelf to him as to his generous Defender to whom he owed his Life, he never would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, but conſtantly followed him, like as a Faithful Dog will do his Maſter, without offending any Perſon except his Enemies upon whom he gave him a Sign to fall. For the Lyon went ever with him to the Combat and the Chaſe, and never failed to provide his Maſter of Veniſon. But that which is moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, that the Maſter of the Veſſel upon which <hi>Geoffry</hi> returned into <hi>France</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> refuſing to take his Equipage aboard, and amongſt them the Lyon who followed his Maſter, the poor Beaſt unable to ſupport the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from his Benefactor, taking the Sea, ſo long as his Strength laſted ſwam after the Ship, till at laſt he was drowned. A marvellous Inſtruction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Reproach to Mankind, whileſt it ſhews them that Lyons have done more than once that for their Maſters, by the Inſtinct of natural Gratitude, than men can be perſwaded to by all the Force of Reaſon; and that Ingratitude which is ſo common among men, defacing the faireſt Character of Humanity, ſhould not be found in the moſt Savage Creatures, whom the Charms of good Offices have deveſted of their natural Fierceneſs towards their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our Hiſtory, The taking of <hi>Marra</hi> revived the ſleeping Quarrel between the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tarentum.</hi> For the Earl pretended to diſpoſe of this Place as he had done before of <hi>Albaria</hi> and <hi>Rugia,</hi> upon which he had ſeized during the Summer: but <hi>Bohemond</hi> who thought there was no manner of Reaſon that <hi>Raimond</hi> ſhould do that here, which he would not ſuffer to be done at <hi>Antioch,</hi> oppoſed him ſtoutly; and in the Diſpute they ſo heated one the others Spirits, that the <hi>Tarentine</hi> thinking he had Reaſon to do the ſame on his part, returned, and immediately drove out all the Earls Forces out of the Forts which they held at <hi>Antioch.</hi> The Princes themſelves could in no fort diſapprove of this Procedure, which they found to be but reaſonable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially after having diſcourſed <hi>Raimond</hi> at <hi>Rugia</hi> between <hi>Marra</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> they found it impoſſible to perſwade him to hear Reaſon, which obliged them to leave him and return to <hi>Antioch.</hi> Thus the great Deſign of the Conqueſt of the Holy Land, which all the Forces of the <hi>Infidels</hi> had not been able to hinder, ſeemed in a manner to be ruined by this Difference between two Perſons, otherwiſe reputed extraordinary Virtuous, and as wiſe as any of that Age.

Now in Regard the Principal Deſign was to go immediately to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to leave the Conqueſt of the reſt till that was taken, the Princes thought fit to accept their Offers; only the <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Tripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> was refuſed; for Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> perſwaded them to beſiege <hi>Arcas</hi> by Reaſon of the Advice which he received from ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who were detained Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at <hi>Tripolis,</hi> that it would either eaſily be taken, or that the <hi>Emir</hi> to obtain Peace would compound with them for a mighty Sum of money, and likewiſe reſtore them to their Liberty. <hi>Arcas,</hi> which others call <hi>Archis,</hi> was a very ſtrong Town ſituate upon a Hill ſome two Leagues from <hi>Tripolis,</hi> and one from the Sea, in the middle of a moſt beautiful and fertile Plain which extends it ſelf along the <hi>Lebanon</hi> and <hi>Antilebanon</hi> to the Sea ſhore.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> This brave Lord being one Night about to go to Bed having fought ſtoutly all that day, he ſaw his excellent Friend the young <hi>Engelram</hi> the Son of the Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who a little before was ſlain at the Siege of <hi>Marra,</hi> enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Tent. Now <hi>Anſelm</hi> who had an undaunted Soul, and to whom the Sight of his Friend gave an extraordinary Joy, <hi>And how now my dear</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelram, ſaid he, without being at all diſordered, <hi>are you ſtill alive, whom I ſaw dead at</hi> Marra? <hi>Thoſe,</hi> replyed Engelram, <hi>who finiſh their Lives in the Service of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>never die. But how comes it,</hi> Said <hi>Anſelm, that I ſee you now incomparably more beautiful than you were before? Look,</hi> replyed <hi>Engelram,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a moſt admirable Structure in Heaven, <hi>look there, and ſee the Brightneſs and the Beauty of that Palace; it is from thence that I have what you ſo much Admire in me. And further,</hi> added he, ſeeing him tranſported with the Admiration of that Beautiful Palace, <hi>I am to acquaint you, that there is one far more Glorious preparing for you. Adieu till to Morrow.</hi> And thereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſappeared. Early the next Morning <hi>Anſelm,</hi> having made his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſend for the Prieſts, he received the Sacraments, and very pleaſantly ſaid to his Friends, that they ſhould not be ſurprized at what he was to tell them, but that though now they ſaw him in perfect Health, yet aſſuredly he ſhould die that day, and thereupon he related to them what he had ſeen the Night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding before he went to ſleep. And the Event verified his Prediction; for the Enemy making a furious Sally, <hi>Anſelm</hi> who never failed upon ſuch an Occaſion, ran thither with his Sword in his Hand, when a Stone which was diſcharged from an Engine, hitting him upon the Head, ſent him inſtantly to that Beautiful Palace which <hi>Engelram</hi> told him was preparing for him in the Heavens. Now in Regard that he who recounts this extraordinary Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, affirms upon his Salvation that he faithfully writ what he ſaw himſelf, and that beſides, one cannot reaſonably accuſe ſo brave a Man as this famous Earl of <hi>Bouchain</hi> and <hi>Ribemont,</hi> as guilty of ſo much Weakneſs, as to make him paſs for a Viſionary Extravagant, I cannot believe there is the leaſt Place for calling in Queſtion the Truth of this Relation. And from hence our Brave Men may draw an Excellent Inſtruction, and learn that in making a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> War, whether it be againſt Infidels, or Hereticks, or whether it be in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their own Prince who is only reſponſible to God for the Juſtice of his Arms, which the Subjects have no Authority to examine, there is ſuch an Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Glory in Heaven to be acquired by their Courage on Earth, that they ought to expoſe their Lives with all imaginable Frankneſs, to all ſorts of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>After this all the Advantage that was gotten during this Siege before the Arrival of the other Princes, was, that <hi>Raymond</hi> Viſcount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> having with him the Viſcount <hi>de Caſtellane,</hi> the Lord <hi>Albret,</hi> and ten or twelve other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and <hi>Bearnois</hi> with about one hundred Horſe and two hundred Foot took <hi>Torloſa,</hi> in old Time called <hi>Antaradus,</hi> a fair and great Town upon the Coaſt over againſt the Iſle of <hi>Aradus,</hi> ſix or ſeven Leagues from <hi>Arcas</hi> towards <hi>Antioch.</hi> He thought to have taken it by Surprize; but that Deſign did not thrive, by reaſon he had ſo ſmall a Number of Men, wherefore in the Night, at the ſide of a Wood which was in View of the City he cauſed ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Fires to be made, that the Inhabitants taking his Party to have been the Van of the Army, and that all the reſt was now come up to aſſault them the next day, they fled away that Night, ſo that the Viſcount entred it the next Morning without Reſiſtance, and there found ſo rich a Booty as rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole Army.</p>
                  <p>This Valiant Viſcount was the Chief of that Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Turenne,</hi> which in Concluſion about two hundred years ſince happily fell into that <hi>de la Tour d' Avergne,</hi> which by taking up the Name hath reſtored it not only to its firſt Splendor, but hath alſo advanced it by an other Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> to the higheſt pitch of Honor to which it could aſpire. This is he who after having done ſo many fair Actions in commanding the <hi>French</hi> Armies in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> as beyond Contradiction have given him the Reputation of a moſt accompliſhed Captain, came to add to the Heap of his Glories the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Kings Commands in this laſt Campagne, and who may well be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64918:43"/>as the chief Engineer of the Military Art,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> and Maſter of all thoſe great Qualities which are requiſite in the Character of the moſt compleat General of an Army, all which are ſo conſpicuous in him, as juſtly render him one of the moſt admired, able, brave, and eminent Generals, even in the Opinion of the Confederates his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, it will be difficult to find any thing more admirable than the War of this Campagne, of more than ten Months Continuance, wherein he by his ſole Preſence, and the terror of his Name, not only ſtopped the Courſe of the greateſt Army of his Enemies, and hindred them from entring into the Provinces, whileſt in the mean time the King finiſhed his Conqueſts; but alſo in Concluſion, won two Battles, one on this, the other on the further ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> conſtraining them in Diſorder to retire as far as the River of <hi>Mein;</hi> and after that terrible Inundation of ſixty thouſand <hi>Germans</hi> had thrown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over the Bridge of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> he there gave them the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of weakening themſelves by Famine and Sickneſs; after which, in the very Heart of Winter he marched againſt them over the Mountains and the mighty Snows, and there either cut in pieces, and diſperſed, or made Priſoners their forwardeſt Troops in three Combats; and in Concluſion, obliged the reſt, which he had reduced to one half of what paſſed the Bridge, to repaſs it with ſo much Precipitation and Shame, that to ſave themſelves in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they would not give him the Opportunity to Attacque them. Thus it was that he ſuſtained the Glory of that illuſtrious Name, and rendred that of <hi>Turenne</hi> far more glorious than it was in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> after that Viſcount <hi>Raymond</hi> alone took ſo great a City.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Earl <hi>Euſtace,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who Marched in the month of <hi>March,</hi> with their Armies in very good Condition, Beſieged <hi>Giblet,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Gabala,</hi> a Town upon the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> but being requeſted by the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> to come to his Aſſiſtance upon the Rumor which he had cunningly raiſed, that a great Army of <hi>Saracens</hi> were advancing to Aſſail him; they accepted the Terms which the Governor offered them to obtain a Peace, and came inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before <hi>Arcas,</hi> where they found no other Enemies to Combat with, but thoſe who were within the Town, who made a very brave Defence. But the two Ambaſſages which the Princes received ſhortly after, determined the Siege which had been maintained ſo long. For during the Siege of <hi>Antioch,</hi> they had ſent their Ambaſſadors to <hi>Babylon,</hi> with thoſe of the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to conclude with him that Alliance which he had deſired, and which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended unto upon Condition that he ſhould joyn his Arms with thoſe of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with all its Dependancies, ſhould be put into the Hands of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> That he ſhould have ſuch other Places as ſhould be regained from the <hi>Turks</hi> who had uſurped them from him; and that the reſt ſhould be divided among them: But the great Overthrow of <hi>Corbagath,</hi> which that Prince underſtood ſome time after, made him change his Reſolution; for now he imagined that he might make his Advantage of this Victory of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that it would give him the Opportunity, if he knew how to manage it, to recover that by himſelf, which he could expect to have but a part of if he joyned with the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He knew very well that their Army was extreamly weakned by the long Sieges, Diſeaſes, and Combats, which they had indured; and that the Emperor <hi>Alexis</hi> was ſo far from ſending them any Reinforcements, that he urged him inceſſantly to take Arms againſt them, as appeared plainly after the Battle of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> when the Letters which this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Prince had written to him upon this Subject, were found in the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Cabinet: And in ſhort, He was ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the Belief that the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſo drained both of Men and Mony, that they were almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruined, and could not poſſibly after ſuch horrible Loſſes, be in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Oppoſe him with conſiderable Force. And therefore whileſt they were under the Aſtoniſhment of their Overthrow, and that the Princes ſpent their time about <hi>Antioch,</hi> either in Diverſions, or in taking little Places, or that which was far worſe, in vain Conteſts, he ſent a conſiderable Army into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> where he took the greateſt part of the Cities, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64918:43"/>which for a Sum of Mony was ſurrendred unto him by the Governor,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> who ſaw himſelf out of all hope of Relief.</p>
                  <p>After this, when he knew that the Princes were in <hi>Phenicia,</hi> he ſent back their Ambaſſadors, which he had detained above a Year, and joyned with them his own, who were to acquaint the Princes, That having made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which of right belonged to him, he did not think himſelf bound in Juſtice to put it into their Hands; but nevertheleſs, if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> thought good to viſit the Sepulchre, they might do ſo, provided they did not come in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Numbers than two or three Hundred; and that they came as ſimple Pilgrims, without any Arms, and returned immediately ſo ſoon as they ſhould have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Devotions. The Princes filled with Indignation at this Inſolence of a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> thought fit to treat him with Diſdain, and therefore only ſmiling at his extravagant Propoſition, they inſtantly diſpatched his Ambaſſadors to him, with Order to let him Underſtand, That they were not to be treated like Fools or Slaves, but like his, and the Conquerors of the whole <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and that if he did not immediately Surrender <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon this Demand, they knew very well how to take it from him, in deſpight of all the Power of his Empire, of which they made ſo very little Account, that after they had taken it, he might expect the ſevereſt Puniſhment due to his diſhonorable Perfidy, and from which he would find, the proud Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he thought himſelf ſo ſecure, ſhould not be able to protect him.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the Princes gave Audience to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who were ſent from him to Complain, that contrary to the Promiſe of the Princes, <hi>Bohemond</hi> kept <hi>Antioch,</hi> of which he pretended to be Prince, and alſo to deſire them to ſtay for him till <hi>July,</hi> when he would come and joyn them with a puiſſant Army, and all kinds of Proviſions, that ſo they might together, more commodiouſly beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Earl <hi>Raymond,</hi> who preſerved ſtill ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Remains of his Averſion to <hi>Bohemond,</hi> and who feared that they would raiſe the Siege of <hi>Arcas,</hi> which he had given a Suſpicion, that like <hi>Bohemond,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned alſo to keep for himſelf, was of opinion that it was fit to ſatisfie the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to wait his coming before they undertook the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But all the others, who ſaw through the Artifice of the Emperour, who had no other thoughts but to impoſe upon them, anſwered his Ambaſſadours, That <hi>Alexis</hi> having upon all Occaſions acted directly contrary to his Promiſes, they thought themſelves abſolutely diſcharged from the Obligations of theirs; that <hi>Bohemond</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Antioch</hi> with the greateſt Juſtice, all the other Princes having yielded it to him; as for the reſt, that which had already paſſed, anſwered for what was to be expected from him, and that they would no longer regard his Word, which he had with ſo little Honour ſo often Violated; and that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved immediately to advance without him towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in order to the Accompliſhment of their Religious Vow.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, a few days after, having gained a great Victory over the Emir of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> who had the Confidence to ſally out and give the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Battle, they granted him Peace at his Earneſt Solicitation, notwithſtanding that the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> with a ſtrange Obſtinacy, did all that lay in his power to oppoſe it; but with little Effect, more than the Diſpleaſure which he had to ſee himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of all his People, who, as did all the reſt, demanded with an incredible Ardor, without delaying about theſe other Places, to be lead immediately to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Conditions which theſe Victorious Princes made with ſo much Honor and Advantage with the <hi>Tripoline,</hi> were theſe, That leaving to the Emir <hi>Tripolis, Arcas,</hi> and <hi>Biblis,</hi> which were under his Government, he ſhould pay down a large Sum of Mony, and furniſh the Army with Horſes, Apparel, and Proviſions; That he ſhould ſet at Liberty three hundred Priſoners who had been taken during the Siege of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and that if they took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he ſhould become their Tributary, and turn <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> This Treaty was concluded the thirteenth day of <hi>May;</hi> and after the Repoſe of three or four days about <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> the Army put themſelves upon their March, leaving Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> upon the Left, and with good Guides following the Sea-Coaſt-Way, that ſo they might be the more eaſily Accommodated by the Fleet, which conſiſted of <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Genoeſe, Piſans,</hi> and the Pyrate <hi>Vinimarc,</hi> who coaſted all along with them.</p>

He furniſhed them with all ſorts of Refreſhments, and that he might quit himſelf of ſuch Gueſts the Sooner, his Fear conſtrained him to promiſe them with an Oath, That if they took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and kept it twenty days againſt the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would acknowledge them for his Maſters, and put them into Poſſeſſion of the Town; but the contrary was ſoon after evident by a very ſurprizing Accident, which ſhewed that this Perfidious Perſon had quite other Thoughts about his Heart, and that it was his Fear of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, which drew this Perjury from his Lips.</p>
                  <p>For as the Army quitting <hi>Ptolemaïs,</hi> purſued their Way by <hi>Caiphas</hi> and the Paſſage of the <hi>Strait,</hi> which lies between the Sea and Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Encamp near the Lake of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> a Pigeon which was eſcaped from the Talons of a Bird of Prey, who aſtoniſhed at the Noiſe of the Army, had quitted her, fell down half dead at the feet of the Soldiers; being taken up, there was found faſtned to her a little Roll of Paper, in which the Emir of <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> had written to him of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> that he ſhould do all the Miſchief that he could to this <hi>Army of Doggs,</hi> who were about to paſs his Territories, for that he might more eaſily Incommode their Paſſage than he could, and alſo that he ſhould not fail by the ſame way to give the ſame Advertiſement to the other Cities. This Accident occaſioned a wonderful Joy in the whole Army; for from hence they concluded, that God took a particular Care of their Intereſts, ſince he was pleaſed, in ſo uncommon a manner, to diſcover to them the Secrets of their Malicious Enemies. For this very reaſon the Princes ſtaid in that place, that they might with greaten Devotion celebrate the Holy Feaſt of <hi>Whit-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> which was the nine and twentieth day of <hi>May.</hi> After which leaving the Sea upon their right Hand, as alſo the Cities of <hi>Joppa</hi> and <hi>Antipatris,</hi> they took the Right-hand-way which leads through the pleaſant Vallies which lie at the Foot of Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to <hi>Lidda,</hi> or <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Judea,</hi> and at that time particularly Famous for the magnificent Church which the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had cauſed to be built in Honor of St. <hi>George,</hi> in the place where that generous Soldier finiſhed his Martyrdome; but the <hi>Saracens</hi> deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to maintain the Town, had before ruined this noble Structure, burning the prodigious Beams which ſuſtained the Roof, for fear the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould make uſe of them for Engines of War.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Princes ſeized upon <hi>Ramatha,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Arimathea, Rama,</hi> and <hi>Ramula,</hi> a City which the Birth, the Dwelling, and the Sepulchre of the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> have rendred remarkable in the Holy Writings. The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> had alſo abandoned that place in ſo great haſt, that they left behind them ſo much Proviſion as ſufficed for three days to refreſh the whole Army. And becauſe <hi>Rama</hi> was near unto <hi>Lidda,</hi> it was thought fit to give the Fee-ſimple of thoſe two Towns, together with the Tithes of the Booty, to a learned and virtuous Prieſt, one <hi>Robert</hi> of the Dioceſs of <hi>Rouen,</hi> who was ſetled the Biſhop of that place, to the intent that he ſhould not only take Care of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Lidda,</hi> but alſo of ſuch Pilgrims who reſolved to paſs the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Lives in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and with which <hi>Rama</hi> was to be peopled. This being done, the Army marched very early the next Morning Eaſtward, and the ſame Evening arrived at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> ſome ſixty Furlongs, which is about two Leagues and a half from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> This City which had in the time of the <hi>Machabees</hi> been a conſiderable Place, was in our Saviour's time only a little Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, having been ruined by <hi>Varus</hi> the Governor of <hi>Syria;</hi> but it was rebuilt by the <hi>Romans</hi> after the end of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> War, and in memory of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they called it <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> as it was at that time called when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeized it.

Thus the Preſence of thoſe glorious Monuments of the Victories of the Son of God, after theſe firſt motions of Piety, inſpired in the Hearts of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> ſuch an extraordinary Ardor to Conquer, that they cried out to be inſtantly lead to the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not as <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and Murdreſs of the Saviour of the World, to deſtroy it, but as <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and Captive, to deliver it from the Tyranny of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who hindred the whole World from the Liberty of rendring thoſe Honors due to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of Jeſus Chriſt.

For in times-paſt, there was compriſed within the Circuit of its Walls four Mountains, upon which it was ſucceſſively Built: The firſt called <hi>Salem,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>Acra,</hi> which was founded by <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> The ſecond oppoſite to that, towards the <hi>South,</hi> and which was far higher, was the Holy and Famous Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> after he had taken the Fortreſs of the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the former by a Wall which invironed it on all parts, to diſtinguiſh it from the other, which in compariſon of this new City, was called the Lower City: The third was the Mountain of <hi>Moriah,</hi> between theſe towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtood: And the fourth upon the <hi>North,</hi> was the Hill <hi>Betheza,</hi> where the ſame King built a new Town, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards much inlarged by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and took in all the Valley between the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> to the lower Town.</p>
                  <p>This Glorious City of God was afterwards deſtroyed by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> and with the Temple reſtored to its firſt Eſtate, in divers Ages by <hi>Zorobabel, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and by <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, and was at the laſt overthrown to the very Ground, and laid in Heaps of Rubbiſh by the Emperor <hi>Titus Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian,</hi>

But the <hi>Jews</hi> Revolting in the time of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> that Prince after he had made the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Slaughter among the Rebels, cauſed thoſe three Towers and the Wall alſo to be demoliſhed and razed to the very Foundation; thus without deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, intirely accompliſhing the dreadful Prediction of the Son of God, That the day ſhould come when there ſhould not be one Stone left upon another in that miſerable City. After this, that Emperor to immortalize his own Name in aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cauſed a new City to be there Built, which according to his own Name was called <hi>Aelia,</hi> giving it alſo a quite differing Form from the Ancient City, whoſe Memory, as well as Name, he thought thereby for ever to extinguiſh. For he left out of it the whole Mountain of <hi>Sion,</hi> which had been the beſt and moſt Beautiful, as well as ſtrongeſt part of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> almoſt all that which had been called the New City, and a great part of the Lower Town. He made Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> be levelled, and incloſed that and the little Remainder of the New and Low Town, as alſo Mount <hi>Calvarie,</hi> which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little Corner of Mount <hi>Gihon,</hi> which was out of the Ancient City towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi> So that this <hi>Aelia,</hi> as it was not by one half ſo large as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſo it had quite a differing Figure: For the Ancient <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions approached to a Square, though not altogether Regular, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing longer than it was broad, for it was Extended from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South</hi> a good League, the Breadth from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> being ſomething leſs. On the contrary this new City, which was of a Figure altogether Irregular, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to Square, extended it ſelf in Length from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> ſome twelve hundred Paces, and in Breadth from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North</hi> about a third part ſo much. Moreover the Ancient City was wholly inacceſſible on the South part, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the broaken Rocks of the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which Invironed it, it was alſo the ſame upon the <hi>East,</hi> having the deep Valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> between the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> and Mount <hi>Moriah.</hi> But this New City which had Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> cloſe by the South Side of it, was eaſily Commanded from thence, and the Valleys having been in a manner filled up by the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was very acceſſible, particularly upon the <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It continued a long time in this Eſtate under the Power of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till ſuch time as the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> peopled it with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> having there builded the Magniſicent Church of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which Incloſes the Holy Sepulchre, where the <hi>Pagans</hi> had with the moſt impious Profaneneſs erected the Temple of the Idol <hi>Venus.</hi> After this quitting the profane Name of <hi>Aelia,</hi> if recovered that venerable Name of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a Name Conſecrated by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Records, and by ſo many Holy Myſteries, which for ever after to this preſent time it hath retained. It was taken from the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Perſians</hi> under the Reign of King <hi>Coſroës,</hi> and by his Succeſſor Reſtored to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Heraclius;</hi> and not long after, about the middle of the ſeventh Age, falling into the Hands of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the <hi>Caliph Omar,</hi> one of the earlieſt Succeſſors of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> built there a round Temple of eight Angles or Faces for a <hi>Moſch,</hi> in the ſame place where ſometimes ſtood the Temple of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and tho it did not in the leaſt Reſemble that, except in the Greatneſs of the Porch, which was raiſed very high, and with fair Galleries, in the Middle whereof ſtands this Round, yet doth it to this Day retain that Name. About four hundred Years after this, the greateſt part of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> falling under the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they alſo took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thirty eight Years after it was retaken from them by him, making uſe of the Occaſion which was offered him by the memorable Victory of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> over the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the Battle of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Saracen</hi> Prince, who notwithſtanding his Ambaſſy, doubted not but the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who looked upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the end of their Enterpriſe, would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64918:46"/>certainly beſiege it,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> forgot nothing which was neceſſary to put it into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make a good Defence; for with great diligence he cauſed the Walls and Towers to be repaired, although they were very ſtrong before, having alſo a double Wall; he provided the Place with all manner of Stores both of Ammunition and Proviſion, he cauſed all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that were able to bear Arms to quit the City, and put into it a Garriſon of fourty thouſand of his Beſt Soldiers, beſides that there were twenty Thouſand Inhabitants who were Armed, and to whom for their Encouragement he promiſed a perpetual Exemption from all manner of Taxes and Tributes. He cauſed alſo the Ciſterns and Wells for ſix miles round the City to be filled up, and made a moſt horrible Waſt throughout the Country, that ſo the <hi>Christian</hi> Army at the ſame Time that they were to Combat with ſo ſtrong an Enemy within the Walls, might have Famine a more terrible Enemy to Combat with in the Field, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all he hoped to deſtroy them for Want of Water in thoſe dry and barren Countries where the Heat is great and Thirſt moſt inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>This was the Eſtate and Poſture in which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then ſtood immediately before it was beſieged by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe Army was not in Truth ſo Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as that which defended the Place: For of that immenſe Multitude of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> who paſſed into <hi>Aſia</hi> and were at the Siege of <hi>Nice,</hi> there came not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſixty thouſand of both Sexes, among which there were not more than twenty Thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe who were in a Condition to fight; the greateſt part of the reſt being dead, either with Diſeaſes or in the ſeveral Encounters; ſome were returned, ſome wore put into Garriſons in the conquered places, and ſome followed the Princes <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Bohemond</hi> to defend their new Principalities of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> Nevertheleſs both Princes and Soldiers were determined either there to periſh or to carry the Pince, and to accompliſh their Vow either by a Devout Death, or Glorious Victory. After they had therefore repulſed the Enemies who ſallied out, they began chearfully to form the Siege in this manner; <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> Earl <hi>Euſtace</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> took their Poſt upon the Weſt near to the Fortreſs which they called the Tower of <hi>David;</hi> The Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> was upon his Right directly oppoſite to the Gate of this Tower, and after a little while he enlarged his Quarters South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Extremity of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> over againſt the Church of the Holy Virgin. The Remainder of the City on the South and towards the Eaſt was left free, in Regard the Hollow Vallius and the Craggy Rocks made the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Extreme Difficult. The North ſide was ſurrounded by the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who lay before the Gate, which was then called St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> but now <hi>Damaſcus</hi> Gate, to the Angular Tower near the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, that they might avoid a tedious Siege like that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> it was reſolved to attack the Place by main Force, therein alſo following the Advice of a Solitary who lived with a great Opinion of his Sanctity in a Cave in the Mount of Olives; for he had promiſed the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that they ſhould have the Victory that day, telling them he had it in Command from God to acquaint them with that Meſſage, although it was told him on the other hand, that they were not at all provided with neceſſary Materials for an Attack. But as it appeared afterwards, in all kind of Affairs, but eſpecially in thoſe of War, it is a moſt dangerous Folly to quit the Rules of Art and Prudence, blindly to follow the uncertain Ways of pretended Revelations, which one ought rarely to truſt, in Regard they are ſo often falſe; and when they are true one is not bound to believe them but upon Invincible Proofs; and without thoſe one is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged always rather to follow good Senſe and Reaſon, which God hath given to Men next to his Divine Word, to be their Rule and Guide. However, upon the fifth day of the Siege early in the Morning a General Aſſault was given upon the Word of this Recluſe, which was looked upon as an Oracle. Never was there ſeen greater Ardor in the Soldiers, whoſe Courage was redoubled by the certainty of their Belief in the Promiſe of this Holy Man that they ſhould that very day take <hi>Joruſalem.</hi> Some part were drawn up in cloſe Rank, and they advanced holdly after the manner of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelveslike <hi>Tortoiſes</hi> with their Bucklers, whilſt others were extended in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64918:47"/>long ſiles and followed them at a juſt diſtance,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> to have convenient Room to make uſe of their Bows, their Slings and Croſs-Bows, to drive the Enemy from the Walls with great Stones, Darts and Arrows which they ſhowered continually upon them; whileſt in the mean time the firſt endeavoured, in Deſpite of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Rock and Beams which they threw down from the Walls to cruſh them, to come at the Wall, and with Pick-Axes, Mattocks, Levers, and ſuch ſort of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Inſtruments wanting Rams they tried to make a Breach or Paſſage through the Wall; and they acted with ſo much Force and Courage that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Out-Wall, and made a Paſſage to the very Foot of the Inward-Wall; but that being too ſtrong to receive any Damage by ſuch pittiful Tools, there was no Hope but to force the Place by a Scalade; and ſo little Care had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to make Proviſion, relying upon the Promiſe of the Hermit who told them, if they had no more than one Ladder of Oſiers they ſhould nevertheleſs take the City, that when they came to make Uſe of them, there was no more than one ſound Ladder, that was long enough to reach the Walls; notwithſtanding which theſe <hi>Braves</hi> tranſported with mad Courage, being prepoſſeſſed with the Belief that they ſhould carry the Town, planted that Ladder, and mounted with ſo much Reſolution, that puſhing one another upwards, many of them got up to the Top and threw themſelves over the Wall, where they deſperately fought hand to hand againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who were amazed at this more than Heroick Boldneſs; and there is no doubt but if they had had more Ladders, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> had been that day taken; for the Enemies who did not in the leaſt expect ſuch an irregular and brisk Attempt, had not brought any of their Engines to the Walls. But ſeeing there could but by one Ladder mount a very few men, who muſt needs be expoſed to a Multitude of Enemies without Hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, a Retreat was ſounded after having loſt in that raſh Attempt a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave men, who yet ſold their Lives at ſo dear a Rate that twice their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Saracens</hi> paid theirs in lieu of them.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> who was aſhamed of the Fault he had committed by preferring the idle Viſions of a ſimple Hermit before the juſt Rules of Military Art, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the Princes, that if they reſolved to carry the Town by Force it was neceſſary to attack it with good Engines of War, ſince they were to ſight with men who having once, would not a ſecond time be ſurpriſed in their Defence againſt a Scalade. This Advice was approved by all, but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was, to know where they ſhould be furniſhed with Materials to frame them, there being never a Forreſt in all the Country. For as for the famous Enchanted Woods of <hi>Iſmena Clormea, Renaud</hi> and <hi>Armida,</hi> and a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like Inventions of <hi>Taſſo,</hi> they are nothing but the agreeable Viſions of a Poetical Fancy, which takes a great deal of Delight in pleaſing others, with making new Creations, which never were except in his own or the Imaginations of his Readers, but which muſt as the Amuſements of Fables and Chimera's, be rejected by Hiſtorians who are to entertain their Readers with nothing but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Truth. But this is moſt certain, that while they were in this Trouble a Chriſtian of the Country informed the Princes, that about three or four Leagues off in the Way that leads to <hi>Arabia,</hi> there was a Valley quite out of any Road, where in a great Cavern there was a good Quantity of large Beams of Cedar and Cypreſs, and that there was thereabout ſome Trees of which they might make very good Uſe, although they were of no conſiderable Height. The Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> went thither with ſome Troops being Conducted by this Guide, where they really found ſuch Wood which they cauſed to be carried to the Camp. They alſo carried thither all the Planks, Joiſts and Beams of the Houſes near the City, which they could ſind; and for a whole Month they wrought all ſorts of Engines which are made uſe of in Sieges, as alſo ſome of a new Invention, according as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> who took care of the Management of theſe Works; but that which mightily advanced them was, that nine great Ships being arrived at <hi>Joppa</hi> with Proviſions from <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> for the Army, and deſpairing to defend themſelves in that little Fleet againſt that of the <hi>Saracens</hi> which was coming to attack them, they broke up the Ships, and ſetting Fire to what they could not carry to the Camp, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64918:47"/>applied themſelves moſt induſtriouſly to the building of theſe Engines.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> All this time the Army was ready to periſh with the exceſſive Thirſt which it indured; for the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> which divides the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> hath very little Water except in the Winter, and the Fountain of <hi>Siloe,</hi> which is at the Foot of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> toward the <hi>South</hi> afforded but a very little Water; ſo that there was ſcarce any to be had but what was to be found two Leagues off, and that with great Hazard of falling into the Hands of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who lay continually in Ambuſcades to ſurprize ſuch whoſe Thirſt conſtrained them to ſtraggle abroad to ſeek for Water; and beſides, what was to be had was ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and there were ſo many People, beſides the Beaſts that were to drink, that it became preſently pudled and ſtinking. In this Extremity there could be no other Reſolution, but ſo ſoon as ever the Engines which were preparing were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to give a General Aſſault, with a ſirm Determination either to carry the Place or periſh in the Attempt. And therefore before the Execution of ſo dangerous an Enterprize, and whileſt the Preparations were making, it was thought fit that publick Prayers ſhould be made by the whole Army, to implore the Mercy of Almighty God and to crave his Bleſſing and Aſſiſtance. For this Purpoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Faſt of three days upon Fryday the eighth of <hi>July</hi> there was a ſolemn Proceſſion, where the Biſhops and Clergy barefooted, followed by the Princes and Soldiers in their Arms ſurrounded the City, ſetting out at the Church of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and paſſing by the Oratory of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> through the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> and ſo by the Mountain of <hi>Olives,</hi> to the Place from whence Chriſt Jeſus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Heaven. Here it was that <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit, and <hi>Arnold</hi> the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> made ſuch Powerful Exhortations to reunite the Hearts of the Army, that all the Chiefs, and the Soldiers, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tancred</hi> and Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> who had had the greateſt Differences, embraced each other in Token of a mutual Reconciliation, and Exhorted one another to revenge thoſe Injuries and Outrages, which were offered to Jeſus Chriſt by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> who at the ſame time made a Mock-Proceſſion about the Walls within the City as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did without, vomiting out a thouſand Blaſphemies againſt Chriſt, and offering a thouſand Inſolencies and Indignities to a Croſs which they oppoſed to that which was carried in this Devout Proceſſion before the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning <hi>Godfrey</hi> who had reſolved to make his Attack upon that Quarter which is between the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> becauſe it was the weakeſt and the moſt convenient for his Engines to play, removed his Camp thither in the Night, and employed the three following Days as did the other Princes to diſpoſe of their Engines. They had beſides Rams, Slings to throw great Stones, and other ſuch Sort of Engines which were at that time in Uſe to batter Walls near at hand, three great Caſtles of Wood of a new Structure. Every one of them had three Stories, whereof the loweſt was for the Ingeniers and Workmen, who by great Force rolled the Machin upon its Wheels; the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their Platforms which jetted out from the Work, ſo that the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who were placed in them might from thence fight as upon ſirm Ground, either with their Enemies at a Diſtance, or near at Hand according as they were able to advance the Machin; the middle Story was as high as the Top of the Second Wall, which was ſomething higher than the Out-Wall of the City. And the third Story which was raiſed with a narrow Top, was ſo framed that from thence one might ſee the Enemies ſo as to have a ſair Mark at them with Darts, Stones or Arrows even to the very Heart of the City. Theſe Wooden rolling Caſtles had four ſides which were covered with Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to prevent the Damage which they might receive by the great Stones thrown from the Walls, and the Hurdles were alſo covered with Raw Hides of Oxen, Camels and Horſes, to reſiſt the Violence of Fire. But that which was the Chief Deſign of theſe Machines was, that upon the ſide of the third Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towards the Town, and which was juſt above the Platform of the middle Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Level with the Height of the Walls, beſides the two other Covertures there was a third which was framed with Joiſts and Planks, and ſo faſtned to the Engine above at the third Platform, that being ſuddainly let down by two Pullies, it was to fall upon the Wall like a Draw-Bridge, thereby to enter into the Town.</p>
                  <p>It was reſolved that there ſhould be three Attacks, and one of theſe Rolling
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64918:48"/>Caſtles at every one of them;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> and Earl <hi>Euſtace</hi> had the firſt, a little below St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Gate drawing towards the Eaſt; Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> Prince <hi>Tancred,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> with the ſecond, made the ſecond a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower at the left Hand near the Angular Tower which was afterwards called <hi>Tancred</hi>'s Tower. Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> made his at the oppoſite Angle at the South-Weſt, with the third which could not advance till he had cauſed certain deep Trenches to be filled up which lay between him and the Wall. Upon Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the thirteenth of <hi>July</hi> the Attack was begun, which was continued all the next day with incredible Fury; all the great Engines which were placed by the Caſtles played inceſſantly upon the Enemies, with Huge Stones, whileſt at the ſame time the Slings, the Archers and Croſs-Bows diſcharged continually upon them, the Caſtles advancing ſtill forward all the Time. The Captains ſtood all this while in the higheſt Story of the Rolling Caſtles, accompanied with the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and braveſt men of the Army, to animate their Soldiers by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and by the Danger which they ran, being above all others expoſed as the Mark of the Enemies Arrows. Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> with his Brother ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt Platform of his Caſtle, from whence whileſt it approached by little and little to the Wall, he continually diſcharged his luſty Arrows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, and againſt thoſe who defended the Walls, ſcarce one of them falling in Vain; for as he was without Contradiction one of the ſtrongeſt men of his Time, ſo he was the moſt dextrous and the beſt Markſman of his Age; which hath given Riſe to the Story, which will have it, That ſeeing three Birds flying to the Top of one of the Towers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhot them all three upon one ſingle Arrow. And for this Reaſon it is, that it is the received Opinion that thoſe vaſt Arrows which are kept in the Armory of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> one of the moſt Illuſtrious of the World, were his, ſince it cannot be doubted but he was deſcended from that Noble Stem. <hi>Godfrey</hi> had placed in the ſecond Stage of his Caſtle the two Brothers <hi>Lethold</hi> and <hi>Engelbert</hi> moſt Vallant Gentlemen of <hi>Tournay,</hi> and <hi>Guicher</hi> the ſtouteſt man in the whole Army, who incountring with a Lyon had cut him in two at one ſingle Blow of his Sword; theſe ſeconded the Efforts of their Noble Maſter, and being accompanied with a many other Gallant Men, they did wonderful Execution with the Sling and Arrows, and in playing their Stone Bows, which without ceaſing poured continual Showers from their Platform upon the Town. The other Princes alſo acted with the like Vigor, ſome levelling the Ground, that ſo the Caſtles might more eaſily advance, whileſt others preſented the Scalade in many ſeveral places together, thereby to make the greater Diverſion to the Defendants, whileſt at the ſame time the Walls were battered continually with mighty Rams. There was one of a Prodigious Magnitude, with which after they had overthrown the Out-Wall to make Way for Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Caſtle, they alſo played ſo vigorouſly againſt the Inward Wall that therewith they made a very great Breach.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe within the Town in the mean time ſorgot nothing which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the rendring the Attempts of the Beliegers fruitleſs, whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded both in Number of Men and Engines. All their Walls were covered with them, and they oppoſed four of an extraordinary Size againſt the three Rolling Caſtles, from which they diſcharged Stones of a Prodigious Bigneſs, which hitting the Engines fell upon the Platforms with a Terrible Noiſe, cruſhing, overthrowing and tearing all in pieces, breaking the Braces and Poſts, and cruſhing all thoſe who did not quickly get Shelter from that furious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. The very Air was obſcured with that mighty Hail, and the Stones which were diſcharged from one ſide and the other encountring one another, ſeemed to Combat as well as the Men, and with a Terrible Noiſe fell down together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Aſſailants, againſt whom the Beſieged ſhoured down without ceaſing their Arrows, Darts and Stones, to hinder their Approaches; they alſo threw abundance of Pots of Fire, and ſhot Fire Darts againſt the Machines to burn them, and at the ſame time made a furious Sally at the Breach which was made by the great Ram, to which they ſet Fire, which was not without great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty extinguiſhed. In ſhort, never was there ſeen ſo long an Aſſault, nor a Combat maintained with that Equal Obſtinacy on both Parts, for it was only the Night and the extream Wearineſs that obliged
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64918:48"/>them on both ſides to give over as it were to take a little Breath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> The Night it ſelf however did not paſs in over much Tranquility on either part; The Beſieged were in continual Fear to be ſurprized under the favour of the Darkneſs; and the Beſiegers, leſt they ſhould ſally out to ſet Fire to the <hi>Machines</hi> which were already much indamaged, and eſpecially that of the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> which was rendred in a manner wholly unſerviceable. But however they wrought ſo hard upon it in the Night, that the next morning the Combat was renewed on one ſide and the other with more Fury than before. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> irritated by ſo long a Reſiſtance made their utmoſt Efforts, reſolute either to loſe all or to gain all; and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> animated by the Succeſs of the two preceding days, and by the hope of preſent Succour, which the Sultan of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> had promiſed them, fought with new Courage, and with ſo much Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Victory, that they could not forbear inſulting over their Enemies, and aſſailing their Aſſailants. Above all they aimed at Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> againſt whoſe Machin, whileſt it advanced over the great Breach in the Out-Wall, they threw a vaſt Quantity of Fire-Works and huge Stones, one of which cruſhed with its fall one of his Eſquires juſt by his ſide. There were alſo two famous Magicians whom they brought to the Walls, who promiſed to ſtop the Dukes Caſtle by their Enchantments; but while the poor Wretches were buſie muttering their fooliſh Charms, a great Stone thrown from one of the Dukes Slings ſpoiled their Conjurations, &amp; cruſhing them both together ſent them down to thoſe Infernal Spirits which they were in Vain calling up to their Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſault had now laſted till one of the Clock in the Afternoon without any manner of Appearance of Advantage than it was the day before, when the Soldiers diſcouraged to ſee themſelves ſo often repulſed, began a little to relax of their former Ardor, and indeed to recoil in Deſpair of ever being able to force ſo many brave Men who defended themſelves with ſo much Vigor and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which the <hi>Saraſins</hi> perceiving ſent forth great Cries of Joy, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with Horrible Blaſphemies and Inſulting Language againſt the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> reproaching them with the Cowardize and Impotence of their Cruciſied God; when Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> whether he really was aſſured that he ſaw it, or whether his Imagination heated by the Ardor of the Combat and filled with the Images of War repreſented it to him, cried out amain, That Heaven was come to their Succour, and that he ſaw upon his left hand upon the Top of Mount <hi>Oliver</hi> a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Cavalier, who ſhaking a ſhining Buckler towards the City gave the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to enter it: And that which is moſt ſurprizing is that the Earl of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> who fought at a great diſtance from him againſt another part of the City, declared the ſame thing at the ſame time to his Soldiers; ſo that one muſt either conclude that theſe two Princes had before agreed this matter between them, to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Men when they ſaw them a little abate of their Courage and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; or elſe that by chance ſome Cavalier of the Army at that time getting upon that Hill, was by the Princes who ſaw him at the ſame time taken for a Warriour-Saint who was deſcended from Heaven to their Succour. Let it be as it will, it is certain that this Viſion, or at leaſt the Belief that it was very true, had the moſt admirable Effect that ever was ſeen; for no ſooner was the Report blown about, but the Soldiers perſwading themſelves that it was St. <hi>George,</hi> who as the whole Army believed he had done at the Battle of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was come again to ſight for them, inſtantly reaſſumed ſuch a new Courage that they became quite other men; for they returned to the Combat like ſo many furious Lions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all, without diſtinction of Age, Sex or Condition, ruſhed in to the Aſſault, the Sick and Maimed not Excepted, ran before the Rolling Machins; ſo that having in leſs than an Hour levelled the Way which hindred their advancing, they puſhed them Home to the innermoſt Wall, where for ſome time they fought at puſh of Pike and Javelin.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Godfrey</hi> who was reſolute to throw himſelf into the Town, bethought himſelf of an Invention which facilitated his Paſſage and cleared the Walls in a Moment; for the Enemies to break the Force of the Blows of the Stones and Rams which battered the Walls, had put abundance of Sacks filled with Chaff, Hay and Wool, Rugs, and Alatreſſes, pieces of Cables and Ropes, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other things of that Nature which they thought would by yielding and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> defend the Walls from thoſe Blows of the battering Engines; the Duke perceiving that the Wind blew at <hi>North,</hi> and was upon his Back, made a great quantity of fire Darts be ſhot againſt that ſoft and combuſtible Matter, which catching hold of them, very eaſily ſet them in a moment all into a Blaze; the Flame which roſe very high, with a mighty thick Smoak, being driven by the Violence of the Wind, upon the Faces of thoſe who defended the Walls, and the two adjoyning Towers, on the Right and Left, they were forced at laſt to Retire and leave the Place Empty. The Duke thereupon immediately letting down his Draw-Bridge, which was of an exact Height to reſt upon the Wall, deſcended inſtantly to the ſecond Stage, where putting himſelf at the Head of all thoſe brave Men which accompanied him, he threw himſelf, with his Sword in his Hand, into the Town, having at his Side <hi>Euſtace</hi> his Brother, <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Bourg</hi> his Couſin, and the two Valiant Brothers of <hi>Tournay, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thold</hi> and <hi>Engelbert,</hi> who were followed by the brave <hi>Guicher,</hi> and that choice Troop of Lords and Gentlemen, who never Abandoned the Duke. In a little while after, the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Tancred,</hi> having uſed the ſame Artifice to drive the Enemies from the Walls, threw their Bridge over the Wall alſo, and entred at the Angular Tower, being ſollowed by <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> the Earls <hi>Hugh de</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Gerrad de Rouſillon, Raimband de Orange, Louïs de Mouſon, Conon de Montaign, Lambert</hi> his Son, and all the reſt, who deſired to have a ſhare in the Glory of theſe great Men.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Inſtant, the Soldiers ſeeing that the Princes threw themſelves into the Town, followed by the principal Perſons of the Army, they were ſo Animated, that they ran to the Aſſault of their own Accord, every one in the way that his Courage Inſpired him with, theſe preſented the Ladders, and puſhed one another forward to gain the Battlements which the Enemies had Abandoned, thoſe mounted the ſecond Stage of the Caſtles, to paſs over the Bridges, and the greateſt part deſperately threw themſelves in at the Breach which had been made the day before; ſo that all the <hi>North</hi> Side of the Town was immediately filled with the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who ran to break open the <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> Gate, by which the reſt of the Troops inſtantly Entred. So that the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being now Aſſured, they uſed the Right they had to it, with the utmoſt Rigor, againſt thoſe Enemies which they thought they were bound utterly to Exterminate, to Revenge the Outrages which they had Committed againſt Chriſt Jeſus, and the Barbarous Cruelties which they had ſo often Exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> All being promiſcuouſly put to the Sword, except ſuch as acknowledged themſelves to be of that Religion; all that were found in the Streets or Market-places were cut in pieces, and nothing was to be ſeen but the flying off of Heads, Leggs and Arms cut off, and the Carcaſes of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred Bodies; the Streets ran with little Rivulets of Blood, and it was impoſſible to ſtep without treading upon Bodies of Men dead or dying; and few there were that eſcaped this firſt Fury, for the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> mingling with the Soldiers, ſhewed them the Houſes of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who killed the very Children in the Arms of their Mothers, if it were poſſible to extinguiſh that accurſed Race, as God had ſometimes Commanded the wicked <hi>Amalekites</hi> to be Deſtroyed utterly. The greateſt part however of them, ſaved themſelves in the Palace and in the Temple, believing they ſhould there find a Sanctuary, till this firſt Fury of the Vanquiſhers began to Relent: But the Vengeance of God which purſued them, made them Aſſemble thither, to deliver them all together, more eaſily into the Hands of thoſe whom he had choſen to Execute the Sentence of his Juſtice againſt them; For <hi>Tancred</hi> and <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> followed with great Numbers, Forcing thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, made ſuch a horrible Slaughter of thoſe Miſerables, that thoſe who Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that lamentable Spectacle, aſſure us, that the Temple and the Porch, were ſo filled with Blood, that it flowed in great Streams, and that they were forced to wade out of it quite over their Shoes.</p>
                  <p>All this while Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> combated ſtill upon his Quarter, with thoſe who defended that part of the Town which lies between the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> hard by the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> where the Emir or Governor fought in Perſon.

                     <hi>Godfrey,</hi> that the Town was taken; <hi>Ha! what?</hi> cried he to his People,

                     <hi>The</hi> French <hi>are already in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and we are yet diſputing our Entry with theſe</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins. Theſe Words ſo Animated the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and the <hi>Provencals,</hi> that ſome planting the Ladders, and others throwing the Bridge of their Caſtle over the Wall, they threw themſelves in Flocks into the Town, where the Enemies, who at the ſame time underſtood by the horrible and conſuſed Cries behind them, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had carried the Town, immediately ſled and retired into the Fortreſs; the Governor then ſeeing the Town was taken upon all Sides, offered the Earl inſtantly to ſurrender the Place, provided he would ſave his Life, and give him Liberty to Retire to <hi>Aſcalon:</hi> This, the Earl, who was glad to have ſo ſtrong a Fort in his Power, eaſily accorded to; ſo the Emir opening the Gates, all the Earls Army entred the Town, and began on their ſide to do the ſame Execution which the Troops of the other Princes had done; all went down without Quarter, in the Streets, in the Houſes, and in the Porch of the Temple, where they ſiniſhed the Slaughter of thoſe who had eſcaped the Maſſacre which their Companions had made. The Number of the Slain in this only Quarter, amounted to ten thouſand, thoſe which were Slain upon the Walls, in the Streets, and Houſes, could not be Computed; it ſuffices to ſay, that all were Slain, except a very few Slaves who were ſpared to cleanſe the City, which was doing for three days after, the dead Carcaſſes being piled up in prodigious Heaps in the neighbouring Valleys, and ſo Burnt. There were about three hundred <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who had ſaved themſelves from the Slaughter, in the Temple upon the Roof, who having obtained their Lives of <hi>Tancred,</hi> and his Banner, which they erected in token that he had taken them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but the next Morning they were all ſlain by ſome of the other Troops, whereat when <hi>Tancred</hi> was mightily diſpleaſed, looking upon it as a baſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other Princes appeaſed him, by remonſtrating to him, that it might be of dangerous Conſequence to ſpare thoſe People, who might do them a great many Miſchiefs in the War which they muſt expect to make with the Sultan of <hi>Babylon.</hi> In ſhort, never was there ſeen a more Complete and Terrible Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance than this which was taken upon theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> upon this Occaſion; all their Houſes were Plundred, and the whole Army found wherewith to Inrich themſelves beyond Imagination; and ſuch Quantity of Proviſions, beſides what was laid up in the Magazins, as might have ſerved them, if the Siege had laſted, without being raiſed, as long as did that of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the richeſt Booty was that which <hi>Tancred</hi> got in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> from whence he took an ineſtimable Treaſure in Silver, Gold, and precious Stones, all which he moſt generouſly gave to Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> as to the Perſon, to whoſe only Courage and Conduct it was due; and God by this way was pleaſed to make him a Recompence for his Piety, which was no leſs Heroick than his Courage in this Rencounter. For whileſt all the reſt fell upon the quarry of the Spoil, he, ſo ſoon as he had taken Care for the Safety of the Town, went Bare-ſoot, and without his Arms, by the <hi>Weſt</hi> Gate, Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with only three of his own Domeſticks, and ſo Re-entring by the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Gate, he repaired to the Holy Sepulchre, there to pay to Chriſt Jeſus his moſt Humble and Ardent Thanks for the Mercy ſhewn him, in giving him the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, after ſo many Dangers, to Accompliſh his Wiſhes and his Vow, in the Deliverance of the Holy City. There is certainly, nothing that acts ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon the Minds of People, as the Example of their Prince, be it Evil, or be it Good; this Devout Action of Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> did ſo ſenſibly touch the whole Army, that paſſing all of the ſudden, from one Extremity to another, the Princes, the Captains, the Soldiers, the People, and generally all the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> together with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> went in Proceſſion to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the Holy Sepulchre; and that which was moſt Admirable, they there paid their Vows with ſo many Tears and Sighs, and ſo many Marks of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion infinitely Tender, that one could difficultly have believed that theſe were People who had come to take a City by Aſſault, and to make ſuch a dreadful Slaughter among their Enemies, ſeeing them now ſo buſie at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in ſuch deep Meditation of the Myſteries of Religion, which ſeemed to have made ſo abſolute a Change and Alteration in their Hearts, by the Power
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64918:50"/>of that Grace of God,

Thus was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> recovered from the <hi>Infidels</hi> by the Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> in the fourth Year of their Expedition, the fifteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> and which is moſt Remarkable, at the very preciſe Hour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Saviour of the World rendred his Bleſſed Soul into the Hands of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God his Father; as if the Divine Providence had determined ſo to manage the Movements of this great Affair, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould recover his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, expoſing their Lives for his Glory, at the ſame time wherein he had aſſured them of Immortality and Glory in Heaven, by dying upon the Croſs to purchaſe it for them.</p>
                  <p>Eight days after this happy Conqueſt, during which time News was brought of the Death of the Patriarch <hi>Simeon,</hi> who was Deceaſed in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Princes and Lords who followed them, Aſſembled to Reeſtabliſh the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by giving it a King, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the other Princes their Succeſſors had been, till the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity. Count <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> was then propoſed, but whether he thought himſelf in the Age to which he was advanced, too weak to ſuſtain ſo weighty a Charge, or feared that this Civility which was offered him would not ſucceed, in regard his own People, who had already twice forſaken him, acted ſecretly againſt his Pretenſions, he excuſed himſelf by reaſon of his Age, and would by no means ſuffer it to proceed to an Election. The ſame Honor was alſo offered to <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy;</hi> but this Prince having a great Deſire to return as ſoon as he could, had no other deſign but to get his Chaplain to be choſen Patriarch; and it is with great probability of Appearance, that it was he who made the Speech which one of the Writers of that time hath tranſmitted to us, which propoſed that double Election after this manner.</p>

                                 <hi>My Lords, Since it is full time, after having Accompliſhed ſo happily our Vow in this Glorious Expedition, that we ſhould now begin to think of Returning into</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>to Govern in our Perſons thoſe Eſtates which God hath there been pleaſed to give us; and ſince you have alſo thought it expedient, with all convenient Diſpatch, to take care for the Government of this Place, which we came to reconquer from the</hi> Infidels; <hi>Now my Lords, this Capital and Holy City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>being both a Royalty and a Patriarchate, it is neceſſary that it ſhould have both a King and a Patriarchate; the Royalty and the Prieſthood are ſo nearly linked together, and accord ſo well, that the one cannot be without the other; for that hath need of the Prieſthood to procure the Bleſſings of Heaven, and this ſtands in need of the Royalty to ſupport it, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that Spiritual Authority which God hath Inveſted it withal. It is our Duty to give our Aſſiſtance to the Clergy, in the Choice of a Paſtor for this Church, who may be a Man of Wiſdom, Probity, Spirit and Eloquence, capable of ſo great an Office; and all this we have Experienced in</hi> Arnold de Rohes, <hi>who is without Contradiction, the moſt Knowing and Able Man of all the Eccleſiaſticks who have followed the Army; and therefore I am of Opinion that we, who are to take Care, as much as poſſibly we can, of this Church, ought to Recommend him to their Election for a Patriarch. As for that which concerns a King, which is wholy in our own Power, I can ſee nothing that ſhould Oblige us to defer the Election for one Moment, for it is moſt evident that we ought to Chuſe without any ſort of Heſitation, that Perſon, whoſe Piety, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Prudence, ſweet Temper, Clemency, Juſtice, Integrity, Liberality, Experience in War, Generoſity, Valour, Succeſsfulneſs, Reputation, and the Glory which he hath acquired in a thouſand noble Occaſions, whoſe ſtrength of Age, of Body, of Spirit whoſe Nobleneſs, admirable Compoſure, and very Air of Greatneſs and Majeſty, worthy of an Empire, and a hundred other Perfections, conſpire to rank him among the greateſt Kings that ever were. My Lords, All theſe extraordinary Qualities which render themſelves ſo Conſpicuous in the Perſon that poſſeſſes them, make it appear wholy unneceſſary for me to name him, and muſt needs have prevented me in that Deſign, nor is it what I can ſay, but it comes from an Authority far Superior to mine. God himſelf, in giving him theſe ſurpaſſing Advantages above the reſt of Mankind, hath himſelf named the Perſon whom he hath choſen like a ſecond</hi> David <hi>to be the King of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>It is the Illuſtrious</hi> Godfrey <hi>of</hi> Bullen, <hi>Duke of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>and that</hi>—</p>

                  <p>The very ſame day he was Conducted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and there Proclaimed King, amidſt the Acclamations of the whole Army, and all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Country, who came flocking in to Inhabit the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He was there preſented with a Crown of Gold, which he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, proteſting that he would never wear a Crown of Gold in a City where the King of Kings, had for the Sake of Mankind worn a Crown of Thorns. And tho he would not take upon himſelf the Title of King, yet it was conſtantly given him, as all the Hiſtorians of that time, and Poſterity have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince done, to this very Day; and certainly never any King better deſerved to wear that glorious Title, which he adorned with ſo many Royal Actions; the firſt was of Piety, for he Founded two Chapters of Canons in the Churches of the Temple, and the Holy Sepulchre, as alſo a Monaſtery in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> The ſecond was of his Power and Authority, in Obliging Count <hi>Raymond</hi> to put into his Hands, the ſtrong Fortreſs of the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> which he pretended to keep in his Poſſeſſion, at leaſt, till his Return into <hi>France</hi> though he was generally Condemned by the whole Army for it, and even by his own <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and <hi>Provencalls.</hi> The third was an Action of incomparable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conduct, manifeſted in that memorable Victory which he obtained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sultan of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the Sultan coming too late to Succour his People, Advanced with a formidable Army to Beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but King <hi>Godfrey</hi> eaſed him of that Trouble; For ſo ſoon as he received that News, he ſent to recal <hi>Tancred,</hi> and Earl <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who were Marched to take the Fortreſs of <hi>Napolis,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Sichar,</hi> formerly the place where <hi>Samaria</hi> had ſtood: And as theſe two Princes, who were Advanced as far as <hi>Rama,</hi> where they took ſome of the Enemies Scouts, had Advertiſed him, that the Sultan was Incamped at <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> a City upon the Sea-Coaſt, two good days Journeys from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> he reſolved to go to meet him, and notwithſtanding the prodigious Inequality of their Forces, to give him Battle.</p>
                  <p>For this Purpoſe, having firſt Implored the Help of Heaven by publick Prayers, at which he aſſiſted with marvellous Devotion, he parted from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the eleventh day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that <hi>Arnold de Rohes,</hi> who, by an Intrigue, which is no part of my Hiſtory to relate, was now choſen Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the Conſent of the Pope. This new Patriarch, who, for very many Reaſons was not ſo very agreeable to the generality of the People, thought to acquire Reputation, by ſhewing his extraordinary Zeal upon this Occaſion: He therefore left <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite to take Care that Prayers might be made to God Almighty for the happy Succeſs of the Arms of the King, whom he would follow, carrying with him, to Encourage the Soldiers, a part of the Wood of the true Croſs, which an honeſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> had hid during the Siege, leſt the <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſhould profane it. The ſame day the King joyned <hi>Tancred</hi> and Count <hi>Euſtace,</hi> waiting the coming up of the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and Earl <hi>Raymond,</hi> who met him at <hi>Ibelin,</hi> which was Anciently the City of <hi>Gath,</hi> one of the five Cities of the Lords of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> ſome few Miles from <hi>Lidda</hi> and <hi>Ramula.</hi> The next day they advanced together to the Brook <hi>Soreck,</hi> which was not above two or three Leagues from the Enemies Camp.

Never was there ſeen a greater Ardor than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Countenances of the Soldiers upon this Occaſion; ſo much Joy, and ſo much Aſſurance of Victory appeared amongſt them, tho they were but a handful of Men in compariſon of the infinite Multitude of their Enemies; for thoſe who ſpeak with the leaſt, aſſure us that there were a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and above three hundred thouſand Foot in their Army; for the Sultan, who had ſet his Reſolution, either to Preſerve or Recover <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had Amaſſed all the Soldiers, that poſſibly he could, out of <hi>Egypt, Lybia, Affrica, Ethiopia, Arabia,</hi> and the Towns which were yet Poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who joyned with him againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as their common Enemies: And the Hiſtorians who ſpeak the moſt of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> will not allow them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty thouſand, among which, about five thouſand Horſe, they being not in a Condition to Re-mount the Cavalry ſince the Taking of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But that which gave this Confidence to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> beſides the Contempt which they had of theſe Numbers of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> which they made no account of, was the Zeal which they had for the Glory of Chriſt Jeſus, and the eager De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which boyled in their Hearts, to Revenge the horrible Blaſphemy of the Sultan: For they had learned from the Priſoners, that this impious Miſcreant had haughtily threatned to Extirpate all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and their Religion out of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that he would raſe the very Foundations of the Holy Sepulchre, and utterly Ruine all the Monuments of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and thereby ſpoil the Longing of thoſe of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to make any more ſuch Voyages to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They paſſed then over the Torrent, with Trumpets Sounding, and great Shouts of Joy, as if it had been in Triumph, and that they intended with their ſmall Army to Affront the mighty Number of their Deſpiſed Enemies: But it happened by a very ſurprizing Accident, that the Miſtake of their Enemies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Defect of their Number, by making them appear to be far more than in Reality they were, which miſtake produced all the Effect that could have been hoped or wiſhed, had they been really ſo many as they appeared to be; for that mighty number of Cattle which had been taken the day before, and which the King had forbidden the Soldiers to meddle with, followed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as they paſſed the Rivulet, and without being in the leaſt Conducted by any, Ranged themſelves in the order of Troops upon their March, as if it had been the Rere-guard of an Army, extending themſelves to the left Hand, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foot of the Mountains which border upon the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> covering all that large Campain, which from the Brook extends it ſelf even to <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> which lies on the right Hand upon the Sea Coaſt; and as theſe Animals filled all the Plain, even to the Mountains, and that the Horſes Excited by the Noiſe of the Trumpets, fell to Neighing, according to their couragious Nature, in ſuch a manner that they might be heard afar off, ſo theſe great Herds of other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in Marching, raiſed ſuch mighty Clouds of Duſt between them and the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> that not being able to diſtinguiſh clearly, they took them for part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, and particularly, for Squadrons of Cavalry, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Fear alſo multiplying them in their amazed Imaginations, they conjectured that their Number was not at all inferior to theirs; whereupon they were Seiſed with a general Conſternation, and not being able to diſabuſe their troubled imaginations, they ſtood as if they had been ſtupid, thinking they were to deal with a million of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſince the taking of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> were Arrived from the <hi>Weſt.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time the Armies being thus near, there was a neceſſity of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was divided into three Bodies, Count <hi>Raymond</hi> Commanded the Right Point, which was extended to the Sea, that ſo they might not be Surrounded on that ſide; The King took the Left, that ſo he

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> and <hi>Gaston de Foix</hi> were in the middle with the main Body of the Battle: Theſe three Bodies were ranged upon two Lines, in the firſt of which were drawn up the Infantry with very large Intervals between the Batalions, and in the ſecond the Cavalry, following here in the new Order which the King had given and which was moſt exactly well performed, thereby to put the Enemies in Diſorder; The Enemies were alſo drawn up in two long Lines, wherein the Batalions and Squadrons, had a great depth and looked like two great Armies ſeperated one from the other a great diſtance, that they might not confound and indamage one another by reaſon of their Multitude. The Lieutenant General, who was an <hi>Armenian Renegade,</hi> and the ſame that had taken <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the <hi>Turks</hi> the Year before, commanded the Right Wing, where were the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Auxiliary Troops and the greateſt Part of the Cavalry, which enlarged themſelves towards the Mountain to charge the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Flank. The <hi>Affricans</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> were in the Left, and the Sultan himſelf with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with all his Braves of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> was in the main Battle; the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had the Van in Regard of their manner of Fight, which was to expect the Enemy with one Knee upon the Ground, and after having in this Poſture diſcharged their Arrows, they made uſe of certain Iron Flails with which they diſcharged weighty Blows upon the Casks and Bucklers of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to break them in pieces; The Sultan had cauſed it to be proclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ranks as they ſtood in <hi>Batalia,</hi> that there were no more <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than that pittiful Company which faced them, and that the great Number with which their Imagination was ſo diſturbed was nothing but a pure Illuſion; that he would not have them permit one ſingle man of theſe Robbers to eſcape, whom the Deſpair of being able to eſcape his hands, and no other reaſon had brought to the Battle. But the fear which had already ſeized upon the Judement of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> would not ſuffer them to underſtand any thing that was ſaid, nor give them leave to diſbelieve their miſinformed Senſes, which told them they ſaw what indeed was not, an infinite Number of Enemies whom they were to encounter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cruſades</hi> all this time advanced ſtill deliberately, encouraged by the King, who ſpoke much better to them by the Language of that Joy which they ſaw in his Countenance, the Fire that mounted into his Eyes, and the Aſſurance of his Mine, Fierce and yet ſeeming to deſpiſe and contemn his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and by the Terrible Glittering of his Sword, than by any words he could have ſpoken, which would difficultly have been underſtood among the Noiſe of the Trumpets and the chearful ſhouts which the Soldiers gave when they ſaw him in that Condition. So ſoon as they were come within diſtance, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry according to the Order which had been given, all together diſcharged their Arrows, and at the ſame time the Horſe ran at full Speed in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between the Batalions, with their Lances couched againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and performed the Charge ſo ſwiftly that they did not give them Liberty to draw their Bows; above all, the Brave Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in every Battle to diſtinguiſh himſelf by ſome great and Illuſtrious Action, having obſerved the great Standard by its ſhining Embroidery of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Golden Apple which gliſtered under the point of it, he ran upon him who carried it, and tumbled him dead at the Feet of the Sultans; all the reſt in their places charged ſo Home, and the Foot alſo without further troubling their Darts or Arrows, with their Swords flew in like Lightning at the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch which the Horſe had made in the Batalions, ſo that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> already ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Fear which their falſe Imagination had imprinted in their Hearts, made a very miſerable Reſiſtance, and ſo abſolutely loſt their Courage and their Senſe, that throwing away their Arms, ſome of them ſtood immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as if they had been ſtupid, and ſuffered themſelves to be Slain without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any manner of Defence, whileſt others of them ſcrambled up the Trees which were there, the Soldiers fetching them down with a certain Cruel Pleaſure with their Arrows as if they had been little Birds; ſome of them threw themſelves down upon the Earth, either thinking to eſcape Death by counterfeiting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1099</label> or as if they ſubmitted to receive it according to the Pleaſure of the Victors, ſome of them crept upon their Bellies, others continued in the kneeling Poſture without ſtirring, as did the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> upon whom <hi>Godfrey</hi> and his Troops fell, cutting off Heads and Arms with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Blows of the Cimiter, in that very Poſture wherein he found them with one knee on the Ground, they never offering to make one Diſcharge againſt him. Thoſe on the Left Wing, where the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and <hi>Provencals</hi> under Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> fought, made alſo a moſt bloody Execution, and charged the Enemy ſo impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that to avoid their Death they haſtened it, throwing themſelves and crouding one another Headlong into the Sea, where they were ſwallowed up in a Moment, ſparing the Victorious <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Trouble of killing them with the Mortal Steel. In a word, all the reſt betook themſelves to flight, and in flying broke and entangled thoſe of the Second Line who had not yet ſtruck a Blow; but yet that did not prevent their having a ſhare in the Misfortune of the firſt, for the Conquerors eagerly purſued the Fugitives, killing them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to the very Gates of <hi>Aſcalon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There the Croud was ſo great, every one ſtriving to be foremoſt to ſave himſelf, and they precipitated one another over the Draw-Bridge in ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that two thouſand of them were drowned and ſmothered in the Moat. The Sultan himſelf unable to ſtop the flight of his Men, had like there to have periſhed; and not thinking himſelf ſafe in the Town he quitted it, and with the haſt of a flying Coward threw himſelf aboard the Ships which he had in the Port loaden with all ſorts of Engines for the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is true that ſome of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> made too much haſt to fall to the Plunder, inſomuch that they were in Danger of being ſurprized by the Lieutenant General who had rallied ſome Troops to make his Advantage of ſuch an Opportunity; but the King whoſe Vigilant Eye was every where, perceiving it run immediately to their Succour, and not only diſingaged his own men, but cut in pieces thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Remnants of his Enemies, and thereby rendred the Victory abſolute and compleat, although it was not yet much above twelve of the Clock. After which he gave the Pillage to the Victorious Army, which got there the Richeſt Booty that they had hitherto met withal during the whole War: for the Great Lords of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all the conſiderable Perſons of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Neighbouring Regions, were come in their moſt magnificent Equipage to attend the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who had alſo brought with him an ineſtimable Treaſure, and vaſt Quantities of all manner of Proviſions for the Entertainment of ſo great an Army: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they who were to ſhare in this prodigious Booty were but an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number in Compariſon of thoſe who had been Parties in the other Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. In this Battle there were ſlain thirty thouſand upon the place, and twice as many in the Purſuit in, the whole above one hundred thouſand Men, without counting thoſe who were ſtifled at the Gate of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> or thoſe others who threw themſelves into the Sea, which though they were a great Number yet it was impoſſible to compute them. On the part of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there was not any one man of Note, nor ſo much as one Horſeman ſlain, and but a very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number of the Infantry, and of thoſe, moſt were of that unruly ſort of Soldiers who disbanded themſelves from their Colours to run to the Plunder. Thus the King having aſſured his new Kingdom by this great and Memorable Victory, led the Army back again loaden with Spoils and Glory to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it entred in a kind of Triumph which was finiſhed by the ſolemn retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Thanks to Jeſus Chriſt at his Holy Sepulchre; There <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> hung up the great Standard of the Sultan, as his Sword alſo, which in his Flight he had let fall, and which to add to his Offering, he bought of a Soldier who had found it.</p>
                  <p>See here the true Account of the Battle of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> which was rather a flight on the one ſide, and a Slaughter on the other, than a Combat; which <hi>Taſſo</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs hath rendred famous by a hundred Beautiful and Magnificent Falſities, which his Art gives him the Licenſe to add throughout his Poem, of which he makes this the Concluſion, as indeed it was alſo of this firſt <hi>Cruſade.</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64918:53"/>that they ſhould have a King who ſhould be actually within the Kingdom,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now in Regard that it was in the Beginning of his Reign that the Order of the Knights Templers were firſt founded in his Palace, and that it is requiſite ſomething ſhould be ſaid of theſe Knights, as alſo of the other Order which was called Hoſpitallers, I think it will not be amiſs in a few Words to inform the Reader of the Original, the Intention, the manner of Living, and the Employ of theſe Military Orders, which were eſtabliſhed in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> under the firſt Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain, that before the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes had conquered the Holy Land there were Hoſpitallers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof ſome received and Entertained the Pilgrims which came from all Parts of <hi>Christendom</hi> to viſit the Holy Places; and others of them had the Charge of the Poor Sick and Diſeaſed People, and particularly of the Lepers of which there were great Numbers in thoſe times; Thoſe who were called the Hoſpitallers of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> are far more Ancient than the firſt of theſe, as appears by the great Number of Hoſpitals and Inſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries, of the Name of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which were wholly intended and principally in the Eaſt for ſuch as were afflicted with the Leproſie. St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> aſſures us, that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> built one at <hi>Ceſarea</hi> dedicated to the ſame Saint, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Protector of the Lepers, and that he gave Rules to theſe Charitable Hoſpitallers, who devoted themſelves to the Service of thoſe diſeaſed People. As for the others who made Profeſſion to ſerve the Pilgrims of the Holy Land, they were not in being till a long time after, that the Merchants of <hi>Amalphi</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> who trafficked into <hi>Syria,</hi> obtained Permiſſion of one of the <hi>Caliphs</hi> to build a Monaſtery near the Holy Sepulchre, to which they added a Hoſpital and an Oratory dedicated to St. <hi>John</hi> the Eleemoſynary, there to receive the poor Pilgrims as well as the ſick and diſeaſed. For after they were embodied into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as formerly they took Care only of the Infirm and Leprous; ſo now there were others who were particularly appointed to attend the Pilgrims, and both the one and the other were indifferently called Hoſpitallers; they lived a long time in this peaceable Exerciſe of Charity, under one Superior who was called the Maſter of the Hoſpital; until that after tho Conqueſt of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> by the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> they took up Arms not only for the Deſence of the poor Pilgrims, but alſo to ſerve the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for whom they performed many notable Services in their Wars. And for this Reaſon the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallers divided their Community into three different Ranks, of which the firſt was that of Knights who went to the Wars; the ſecond of Friers or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Servitors, who had the Charge of the Sick and the Pilgrims; and the third was that of Eccleſiaſticks and Chaplains who adminiſtred the Sacraments; and this Company which was thus advanced into a Military Order was alſo confirmed by Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>It was in Imitation of theſe Armed Hoſpitallers, that many others alſo much about the ſame time, taking up the Profeſſion of Arms at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> began to eſtabliſh other new Military Orders. The firſt were thoſe who had the Guard of the Holy Sepulchre for many Ages, and that King <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Firſt, of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons which they were before, changed them into Knights of the Holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre. They retired after the loſs of the Holy Land into <hi>Italy</hi> where they ſetled at <hi>Perouſe,</hi> and continued there, till ſuch time as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth ſent them to the Knights of the <hi>Rhodes;</hi> the Fathers <hi>Cordeliers</hi> ſucceeded them in keeping the Holy Sepulchre, and to this day retain the Power of giving the Honor of Knight-hood to ſuch noble Perſons as reſort thither to viſit the Holy Places.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, about the Year 1118. nine <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, of whom the Principal were <hi>Hugh de Payn,</hi> and <hi>Geffry de</hi> Saint <hi>Omer,</hi> going to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before <hi>Guarimond</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he perſwaded them ſo Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, that between his Hands they took upon them a Vow of Chaſtity and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64918:54"/>Obedience,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1118</label> and to employ their Lives in defending the Paſſes, and keeping the Ways clear and free for the Pilgrims who came to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> King <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> gave them Lodgings in his Palace near the Temple, and from thence they came to be called Templers, or Knights of the Temple: They continued nine Years in this manner, their Number not at all Increaſing, and without all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Habits, until the Year 1128, when Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them at the Council of <hi>Troyes</hi> a Rule with a white Habit, to which <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Third added a red Croſs. And after that time, as they acquired a mighty Reputation by their Virtue, Courage, and admirable Things which they did againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſo their Order grew mightily, and became ſo Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant, by the great Eſtates which were every where Conferred upon them, that they became equal in their Fortune to the greateſt Princes; But in Concluſion, theſe great Revenues, which at firſt were the Recompences, and the Teſtimonies of their Merit, became the Occaſion of their Misfortune; for from thence ſprung thoſe Diſorders with which they are but too juſtly Reproached, though poſſibly the Hatred into which they fell, by reaſon of their Pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, may have repreſented thoſe Diſorders greater than they were in Reality; yet it is certain that they gave an Occaſion to the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> under <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, utterly to Extinguiſh their Order, the greateſt part of their fair Revenues being given to the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

                  <p>Immediately after the Eſtabliſhment of this Order of the Templers, that of the Knights of the Teutonick Order began, being Founded by the Charity of a Rich <hi>German</hi> Lord, who having had his Part in the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had reſolved there to paſs the remainder of his Days with his Family, in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Piety. He, obſerving that many Pilgrims and poor Soldiers of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuffered extreamly in a Country where no body underſtood them, built a Hoſpital at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to receive them, and ſome time after an Oratory in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Bleſſed Virgin; many <hi>Germans</hi> drawn by the Example of his ſo great Charity, joyned with him, and quitting their Eſtates to the Uſe of this Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, devoted themſelves to the Service of the Poor of their Nation; and there being among them many Gentlemen, who had undertaken this Voyage, principally with a Deſign to make War againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> they added to this Vow, that of Fighting unto Death againſt the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, herein following the Conduct, Manner of Living, and the Rule of the Templers; until that about ſeventy Years after Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the third, Erected it into a milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Order, under the Rule of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> for thoſe of the <hi>German</hi> Nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giving them a white Habit with a black Croſs, to diſtinguiſh them from the Templers. Nevertheleſs, they could after that do no manner of great Services to <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> by reaſon that the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were then become altogether Deſperate; about thirty eight years after, the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, Returning from his unfortunate Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> brought them all into <hi>Germany,</hi> under their fourth Great Maſter <hi>Herman Pſaltza,</hi> to whom he propoſed the Conqueſt of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> from the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People and <hi>Pagans,</hi> who at that time Inhabited there. This Valiant Man entred the Country with his Knights and two thouſand others, who took upon them the Habit after the Example of <hi>Conrade</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> who accompanied him with twenty thouſand Soldiers. In three Years time they made themſelves Maſters of all the Country, Reducing the People to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and Built <hi>Marienburg</hi> to be the chief Seat of their Order, giving it the Name of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> their Protectreſs. After which their Succeſſors Poſſeſſed themſelves of the greateſt part of the Northern Countries, which are on both ſides of the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> Extending themſelves and their Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> continually Augmenting their Power and Dominion, till after a long War which they had undertaken againſt the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that King <hi>Jagelon</hi> Defeated them in that famous Battle, wherein they loſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Knights, who were accompanied with the Slaughter of fifty thouſand of their Soldiers, who remained dead upon the Place.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1118</label> refuſed to do that Homage; and after that the Knights had for a long time, under that Prince, uſed their utmoſt Efforts to maintain their Soveraign Authority; at length, <hi>Albert</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who was choſen Great Maſter, abandoning the Intereſts of the Order, to Eſtabliſh his own particular Deſigns, ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> his Uncle, who of Great Maſter of the Order, made him Duke of one part of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> under the Soveraignty of <hi>Poland.</hi> After which, this new Duke Renouncing the Catholique Religion, and Violating his Vow of Knighthood, Married the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in Concluſion, left to his Poſterity the Ducal <hi>Pruſſia:</hi> So that after this time, this Order, ſometimes ſo Celebrated and powerful, having Flouriſhed more than three hundred Years, was in a manner quite Extinguiſhed: It is nevertheleſs ſtill kept up in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Knights, which are the prime Nobility, poſſeſs great Eſtates under the Authority of the Great Maſter of the Teutonick Order.</p>
                  <p>But whileſt theſe Military Orders began thus much about the ſame time to Eſtabliſh themſelves by little and little in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that of the Hoſpitallers, both Ancient and Modern, which one may ſay, were the Model of the others, made a great Progreſs in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and became of great Conſideration by the great Services which it Performed both in Peace and War, and upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, both the number of Pilgrims, as alſo of Soldiers and Gentlemen, who entred into that Order, increaſing daily, St. <hi>Gerard,</hi> the Provincial of the Iſle of <hi>Martigues,</hi> who was Maſter of the Hoſpitallers, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken from the <hi>Saraſens,</hi> built about the Year 1112. a third Hoſpital, giving it the Name of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and there placed his new Knights, who a little time after began to form the Deſign of following a Conduct and Manner of Living more Auſtere, and more Perfect than that of the old Fraternity. And indeed, when after the Death of <hi>Gerard,</hi> Fryer <hi>Bryan Roger</hi> was choſen by plurality of Voices, to be the Great Maſter of the Hoſpitallers; theſe new Knights of the third Erection of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> perſiſting in their firſt Reſolution of Living in greater Perfection, would needs Imitate the Knights-Templers, and add to their other Vows that of Chaſtity, they ſeparated from the Ancient Hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and choſe for their Maſter Fryer <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Pavia,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiny,</hi> who drew up for them new Conſtitutions, full of ſolid Chriſtian Piety, which may be ſeen in the Book of the Statutes of that Order, with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the Second, in the Year 1123. as alſo the Priviledges which have been granted to them by forty eight Soveraign Popes. After which time, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the other, they called themſelves the Knights of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and wore a white Croſs of eight Angles upon a black Habit. This is that famous Order, which contrary to what uſually happens to other Eſtabliſhments, hath daily Increaſed for above this five hundred Years, Advancing to the ſupreme Elevation of Splendor and Glory, wherein it appears at this very Day: That Order, I ſay, which in all times hath had the Honor to have its Commanders and Knights of all that is Brave and Generous among the Nobility of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and above all thoſe Princes who have been moſt Remarkable, and more diſtinguiſhed by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Merit, than by their Illuſtrious Names or Birth; that Order, in ſhort, which under the Celebrated Names of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Maltha,</hi> hath filled the Earth, the Sea, and all the Corners of our World, with the glorious Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phics of an infinite number of Victories, which they have Obtained againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>

                  <p>As for the ancient Hoſpitallers, who were thus ſeparated from theſe New ones, with whom they formerly made up one Order, under one great Maſter, they ſtill retained their ancient Name of St. <hi>Lazarus;</hi> they added to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of their Knights, a green Croſs, to diſtinguiſh them from the others, and maintained themſelves within the Limits of their firſt Inſtitution, which allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Marriage, conſiſted of three principal Vows; of Charity to withdraw themſelves from the World to the Service of the Infirm and Leprous; of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, either in a ſingle or conjugal State; and of Obedience to their great Maſter; and above all, to be continually ready to Fight againſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> and the Enemies of the Church.

For this Cauſe it was, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eight, at the Requeſt of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſuppreſſed this Order, to Re-unite it with all its Eſtates, to that of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was obtained by <hi>Emery D' Amboiſe,</hi> Great Maſter of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> by another <hi>Bulla</hi> from Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second. But in regard that the Parliament of <hi>France</hi> Declared theſe <hi>Bulla</hi>'s to be Injurious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rights of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> the Patrons of the Order, the Popes <hi>Pius</hi> Fourth, and <hi>Pius</hi> Fifth, cauſed them to be Revoked, upon Remonſtrance thereof made to them by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second; who thought themſelves too nearly Intereſſed in the Commanderies or Places of Truſt which were within their Dominions; ſo that the Order was again Eſtabliſhed, with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64918:55"/>many new Priviledges, by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1119</label> who Created <hi>Jannot de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon,</hi> his Nephew Great Maſter of the Order; after his Death <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth Transferred the Great Maſterſhip to <hi>Emanuel Philibert,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to his Succeſſors, granting him alſo the Union of this Order, with all their Eſtate, to that of the Knights of St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> the Erecting of which the Duke had obtained about a Month before.</p>
                  <p>It ought nevertheleſs, to be taken for Indubitable, that theſe new Creations to the Dignity of Great Maſter of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> were not made but with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to certain Countries; and it is no leſs certain that it was extremely in the Prejudice of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who could by no means loſe that Right, which they had ſo lawfully acquired, and for more than five hundred Years injoyed, to have the ſole Nomination of the Great Maſter, who ought to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at <hi>Boni,</hi> the principal Conventical General Houſe of the whole Order, and who ought to have Juriſdiction over all the Knights of what Nation ſoever they be. Inſomuch, that all thoſe who are called Great Maſters in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, are no more, to ſpeak properly, but Deputies and Subſtitutes, to him who is Eſtabliſhed and Acknowledged in <hi>France,</hi> as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> alledges in his Right, Affirming that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is only his Vicegerent in <hi>Italy,</hi> which alſo a very learned Civilian hath remarked, according to the Bulla of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth. However, after all theſe Bulla's, reckoning from that of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eight, our Kings whoſe Rights are Sacred and Inviolable, have not failed always to name, as they did formerly, without Interruption, the Great Maſters of all the Order of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> both on this and the other ſide of the Sea. And thoſe of the Fraternity following, that is, <hi>Aignan, Claude de Marveil, John de Conty, John de Leui, Michael de Seurre, Francis Salviati, Aymar de Chartres, Hugh Caſtelan de Caſtelmore,</hi> and <hi>Charles de Gayan,</hi> who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and nominated by the Kings <hi>Lewis</hi> Twelfth, <hi>Francis</hi> Firſt, <hi>Henry</hi> Second, <hi>Francis</hi> Second, <hi>Charles</hi> Ninth, <hi>Henry</hi> Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, never failed to take this Quality upon them, altho the deplorable Condition to which the Order was Reduced in <hi>France,</hi> the ſmall Number of Knights, and the Loſs and Alienation of their Eſtates, took from them the Opportunity of maintaining the Dignity of their Place and Order. It was for this Reaſon, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Forth, after he had Gloriouſly Setled the three Eſtates of his Realm, and that after the cruel Diſorders of the Civil Wars, he had put the Kingdom into a flouriſhing Condition, was reſolved alſo to reſtore to its primitive Splendor this Military Order of the Hoſpitallers, from which he perſwaded himſelf he ſhould be able to draw very conſiderable Services. He therefore Choſe for Great Maſter one of the Fraternity, whoſe Name was <hi>Philibert de Newſtang,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whoſe Birth and Merit were equally Illuſtrious. He went upon the King's Account to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to treat about this Affair with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, and did ſo well Negotiate what he had in Commiſſion, that the Quality of Reſtorer, Protector, and Patron of the Order was reſerved to the King; and the Dignity of Chief and General of the whole Order of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> was Abſolutely, and without Reſtrinction, to be in him whom the King ſhould name to be Great Maſter. Moreover the Pope having Created a New Order of Knights, under the Title of our Lady of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> at the Inſtance of the King he United them to that of St. <hi>Lazarus;</hi> after which time the Knights have with this double Title born for their Armes a Croſs, or which is doubled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of eight Points Pometty, between four Flowers-de-Lys, with the Image of our Lady in the middle.</p>
                  <p>But as the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great made the greateſt of all his Noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to Vaniſh, the Order of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which began to Recover after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received theſe new Marks of Honor, did for the main ſtand at a Stay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the Condition wherein he leſt it, till now of late it begins to Flouriſh in ſuch a manner which would make one believe, that we ſhall one day ſee it produce thoſe Fruits, which it was accuſtomed to do in the times of its early Force and Vigor: For the King, who undertakes nothing which he doth not moſt happily Accompliſh, having taken up the ſame generous Deſign of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Grandfather, whoſe Sir Name the Acclamation of all <hi>Europe</hi> hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, will not fail to take all the moſt Juſt and Eſſicacious Ways, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore

Whereupon the brave Earl, raviſhed with Joy at the ſame time that he felt himſelf moſt cruelly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with his Pains and the Approaches of Death, cauſing his Litter to be ſet down in the middle of the Army, he lifted up his Hands and Eyes all Bathed in Tears of Joy, to Heaven, and with great Devotion, he returned his hearty Thanks unto Almighty God, for all the Benefits which he had received from him, but above all, for the Favor which he had now done him, to let him die like a Prince of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> in making War againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and that he permitted him to Vanquiſh with the bare Report of his Approach, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his Name, theſe Enemies of Chriſt Jeſus, and of his Holy Faith.

                  <p>In the mean time, immediately after the firſt taking of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> by <hi>Sanguin,</hi> there being great reaſon to fear, that that powerful <hi>Turk</hi> who had the Courage and Ambition of a Conqueror, would alſo indeavour the Conqueſt of <hi>Antioch,</hi> a Diſpatch was immediately ſent to requeſt the Succours of all the Princes of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> But the principal Application was made to <hi>Lewis</hi> ſeventh King of <hi>France,</hi> to whom the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who were all of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had Recourſe as to their natural Lord, and whom the croſs Accident which happened a little after, put into the moſt favourable Diſpoſition in the World to undertake ſuch an Enterpriſe. This Prince was in the very Bloom of his Youth, being about twenty four Years of Age, he was of a moſt exact Shape, and of a marvellous, and in his Sex an uncommon Beauty, of a ſweet Temper, Civil and Obliging, extream Pious, Tender, and Senſible of the leaſt Sufferings of his meaneſt Subjects, whom he moſt paſſionately Loved, and was no leſs Beloved by them; but above all, he had a moſt mighty Mind, and was as extream Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Authority that it was poſſible for any one to be: And as that Paſſion carried him ſometimes, as it doth more moderate Natures, to ſtrange Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his Sweetneſs, which happened to be miſtaken by <hi>Theobald</hi> Earl of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> who openly eſpouſed all the Intereſts directly oppoſite to his, was changed into ſuch a violent Choller, and furious deſire of Revenge, ſo that having deſolated all the Earls Territories and Poſſeſſions, he took <hi>Vitri</hi> by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, where he put all into Blood and Flames, and miſerably burnt above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Perſons in the great Church, who had fled thither as to a ſecure Sanctuary. This terrible Action which gave a Horror to all the World, was moſt Dreadful to himſelf, when he came once a little to recover out of the Tranſport of his Paſſion; and his Soul was pierced with a Grief ſo lively and ſo cutting, that it almoſt drove him into Deſperation; ſo that for ſome time, he abandoned the Management of all publick Affairs, and even thoſe neceſſary Services due to his Perſon, and it was not without mighty Difficulty, that he was recovered out of that Abyſs of Melancholly, into which he was ſo deeply Plunged. This was the reaſon, that ſo ſoon as ever he underſtood the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities unto which the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> were reduced, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make that his Penance, and to take that dangerous Voyage for the Expiation of ſo great a Crime as he had been Guilty of. So ſoon as he had diſcovered his Deſign to ſome of his principal Officers, they adviſed him, by no means to undertake an Affair of that Importance, until he ſhould firſt have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Celebrated Abbot of <hi>Claravall,</hi> who was at that time the Oracle, not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> It was that famous St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who after the memorable Things which he had done during more than ten Years, towards the Extinguiſhing the Schiſm which the Anti-Pope <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Lions</hi> had raiſed, and the Hereſies of <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Peter Abaillard,</hi> began to take a little Breath in his Retreat at his Monaſtery. He was then about the Age of fifty four Years, of a Stature ſomething above the Middle, having a Face of a very agreeable Compoſure, a delicate Complexion, his Cheeks freſh, and his Hair fair, inclining a little towards too deep a Yellow, his Eyes ſparkling with a kind of ſweet Fire, Lively and Ardent, his Air extream Devout and Modeſt, but ever like a Perſon of Quality with a becoming Aſſurance, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution naturally too Feeble, but much weakened by the Auſterities and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which he had been always moſt aſſiduous in, eſpecially his continual Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Inquiry after Knowledg; but this Weakneſs of his Body was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Force of a Spirit, Lively and Penetrating, Subtile and Dextrous, Bold, yet eaſy and very perſuading, and withal, with a Courage to which the greateſt Difficulties and Oppoſitions were ſo far from being by him thought In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable, that they rather ſeemed to add Fewel to his Flame, and to provide thoſe neceſſary Materials for its Subſiſtence, which gave it Occaſion to burn and ſhine more Warm and Bright.</p>

There it was that this Prince did firſt publickly diſcover the Secret of his Heart, and the Deſign which he had to go in Perſon to the Relief of the <hi>Christians</hi> who were very much preſſed by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> in the Eaſt.

Now as he was obliged inſtantly to give the Aſſembly whoſe Eyes were fixed upon him, his Advice in this Affair, he remonſtrated to them, that in a Matter of this Nature, they ought by no means to paſs further without conſulting the Pope, to whom it appertained to declare the Pleaſure of God in this Holy War, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Second had done in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which had ſo happily ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <p>So ſoon as he had finiſhed his Diſcourſe, the King who had heard him with all the Marks of a moſt tender and ſenſible Devotion, riſing from his Throne, threw himſelf at his Feet, humbly demanding of him the Croſs which the Pope had ſent to this pious Abbot to beſtow upon him: he received it from his Hands with an extreme Reſpect, and having himſelf faſtened it to his Right Shoulder, he did not believe he proſtituted the Royal Dignity in any ſort, by mounting in that Condition up to the Tribunal with St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and from thence to exhort the People, as he did with incredible Zeal, to follow the Example of their King. This Action far ſtronger and more perſwaſive than all the Eloquence of the Saint, was immediately followed with a General Acclamation of all thoſe who ſtood round about, who with one Voice as it were by Conſent cried out, <hi>The Croſs, The Croſs.</hi> And at the ſame time Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> the Daughter of St. <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Guienne</hi> and Earl of <hi>Poitiers</hi> preſented herſelf to receive the Croſs, and was followed by all the Great Men of the Realm, the Principal whereof were Robert Earl of <hi>Dreux,</hi> Brother to the King; <hi>Alphonſus</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Giles, Tierry</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders, Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Nevers; Renald</hi> his Brother Earl of <hi>Tonnerre; Yues</hi> Earl of <hi>Soiſſons, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Ponthieu; Henry</hi> the Son of <hi>Theobald</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois; William</hi> Earl of <hi>Varrennes; Archibald de Bourbon; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerrand de Couci; Geoffry Rancon de Taillebourg; Hugh de Luſignan; William de Courtenay; Renauld de Montargis; Ithier de Thoci; Guicher de Montgeay; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard de Breteil; Dreux de Mouchi; Manaſſes de Bulli; Ancel de Trenel; Guerin</hi> his Brother; <hi>William Bouteiller; William Agilons de Trie;</hi> and among the Prelats, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Noyon; Godfrey</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Langreſs; Alwin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arras; Arnoeld</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lizieux; Herbert</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Sens;</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Colomb,</hi> of the ſame City.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1146</label> The Reſolution of the King, who was preſent at the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, with all the other Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> was there generally approved; and which one cannot without ſome difficulty believe, if St. <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf had not writ it, that which made the greateſt Impreſſion upon Mens Spirits, was that the happy Succeſs of the Voyage, and of the War depended upon him; and that it was there reſolved by a Common Conſent, not only that he ſhould go along with them, but alſo that he ſhould have the General Command of the Army, which could not fail of being always Victorious, under a Cheiſtain, who was believed to be the Diſpoſer of God Almighties Power, by the Gift of Miracles which all the World attributed to him. So eaſily do the Spirits of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with the Opinion of the Sanctity of a Perſon, ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced, to take an irregular Conduct, abandoning good Senſe and that Reaſon which God hath beſtowed upon them to regulate and govern the Deliberation of thoſe Affairs which they are about to undertake. But St. <hi>Bernard</hi> who was a man of a different Complexion from <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit, and who knew admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly how to make Wiſdom and Reaſon conſort with Grace and Devotion, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf ſtoutly againſt this Reſolution, which he believed was wholy diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Prudence and Reaſon. He writ to the Pope concerning it, and made it ſo evident to him who underſtood War, which he did not in the leaſt, that it muſt needs be a Prodigy of ill Preſage, to ſee a man devoted to a ſevere Profeſſion of Religion to take upon himſelf the Command of the Army; that they were at laſt ſatisfied that he ſhould do his Duty according to his Profeſſion, in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up the <hi>Cruſade;</hi> as for any thing more, the Weakneſs of his Natural Conſtitution and his Age gave him a Diſpenſation from the Toils and Hazards of a Voyage to the Holy Land.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore reſolved to preſerve himſelf always within the Bounds of his Condition and to apply himſelf only to that which was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Miniſtry; he ſet himſelf to preach the <hi>Cruſade</hi> with ſo much Zeal, Power, and Succeſs, that there was never ſeen a greater Concourſe of People, then ran from all Parts to have the good Fortune to receive the Croſs from his Hands, <hi>Geoſſry</hi> who writes his Life, that it pleaſed God to confirm and approve of his preaching by a Prodigious Number of Miracles which he did in healing all kind of Diſeaſes by his Prayers and the Impoſition of his Hands. But as ſome of the Hiſtorians who gives us this Account produce no manner of particular Proofs, but content themſelves with ſaying ſo only in general Terms, and on the other Hand it is well known that in thoſe times, they were not ſo ſtrict and exact in their Examination of thoſe kind of Things, as they are in our days, but were rather inclined to make even Credulity it ſelf a Matter of great Merit, I think every Perſon is at Liberty to believe at his own Diſcretion, without detracting in the leaſt from the Eminent Sanctity of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And that which makes this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more reaſonable is that this great man himſelf, in that Apology which he made after the ill Fortune of this Voyage, does not in juſtifying himſelf, in the leaſt inſſiſt upon the Miracles which God wrought by his preaching, but by the Obedience which he owed to the Pope, who had commanded him to preach. Be it as it will; it is moſt certain as he himſelf ſays, the Obedience which he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Pope in preaching the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> became ſo ſucceſsful that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an infinite of <hi>Cruſades;</hi> inſomuch that the Towns and Villages, were almoſt diſpeopled of their Inhabitants, except the Children and the Women, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as Widows during the Lives of their Husbands; thus it was that he ſpoke, not knowing that ſo many of them were to be ſo in Reality. As for the reſt, in that time that he preached with ſo much Succeſs in <hi>France,</hi> he advanced the <hi>Cruſade</hi> no leſs by his Pen in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> whither he writ moſt Eloquent Letters, wherein he Exhorted the People to take up the Croſs, with all the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motives which were Capable of touching their Chriſtian Compaſſion; and in one of them he advertized the <hi>Germans</hi> to take Care that they did not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſeduced by a certain Vagabond Monk one <hi>Radulph</hi> who had taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him without any Commiſſion to preach the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> at <hi>Cologne, Mayence, Worms, Spire, Straſbourg</hi> and thereabouts, exciting the People to Maſſacre the <hi>Jews</hi> under Pretext of ſlgnalizing their Zeal againſt the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt.

He there did his accuſtomed Wonders; and though he preached in a Language which the People did not underſtand, yet ſuch was the manner of his Delivery, that it wrought more upon them, then did his Interpreters who endeavoured to make them underſtand what it was that he ſaid; it was enough that the People ſaw him, to be as it were inchanted by his very Looks, and in Conſequence to be perſwaded; for they ran to him from all Parts with ſuch Heat and thronging, that one time the Emperor was forced to take him in his Arms to defend him from the Crowd which was ready to ſtifle him. In ſhort, he acted and ſpoke ſo effectually in the Dict, that the Emperor and his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> his Nephew <hi>Frederick</hi> who afterwards ſucceeded him in the Empire, and the greateſt part of the Princes reſolved to take upon them the Croſs, which they alſo did about two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at another Diet which was called for that purpoſe.

                  <p>This Great Man who without all doubt was one of the moſt able Miniſters which ever ſerved any of our Kings, was about the Age of fifty five Years, of a Shape and Stature ſomething ſurpaſſing the middle, of a Meagre Countenance, and a Conſtitution Weak and Tender, of a Birth no ways Eminent, but a man of a mighty Soul, and of a Mind raiſed as high as ever any man poſſeſſed, a Spirit lively, Subtile, Penetrating, and of a Prodigious Underſtanding, which he had alſo Cultivated and poliſhed with all manner of admirable Learning, and which was accompanied with a moſt happy Memory and a moſt ſolid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Upon the matter he was Politick, Dextrous, Inſinuating, Perſwaſive, Civil, Obliging, Liberal and Courteous to all Perſons; but on the other Hand he was a moſt admirable Juſticiary, Magnanimous, Fearleſs, Firm and Inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and continually oppoſite to thoſe, who went about to ſhock the Royal Authority, or to abuſe their own by oppreſſing the Weak and Poor. And that which Infinitely heightned the Luſtre of all theſe Excellent Qualities, was that after he had by the Advice of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> reformed both his Monaſtery and himſelf, for during the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs who was none of the beſt bred men of the World, he learnt ſo well to accommodate all the Imploys of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry with thoſe Duties which became him as a Religious and an Abbot, that he lived at the Court as if he had been in his Monaſtery, and when he lived in his Monaſtrey he forgot nothing which was owing to the Court or to the Publick. The King therefore following the Counſel of the Eſtates of <hi>France,</hi> declared him Regent of the Kingdom during his Abſence, giving him for an Aſſiſtant, to command the Military Affairs, <hi>Raoul</hi> Earl of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> who though he was a Prince of the Blood, being Couſin to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs, yet ſubmitted to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Regent without the leaſt Jealouſie or murmuring; ſo much was that of the King reverenced even in thoſe times, though the Royal Power was not then in any meaſure arrived to that high Elevation and Supreme Greatneſs, to which, for the Advantage and Glory of this Auguſt Monarchy we ſee it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this day. And that which was yet more extraordinary in this Choice was, that this Wiſe Miniſter whoſe foreſight was more piercing, and reached further than others, did not only, not adviſe the King to undertake this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but from the Beginning did all that poſſibly he could to oppoſe that Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; foreſeeing without doubt the Pernicious Conſequences, which according to all Appearances in his Opinion it was like to have: So that it was out of pure Reſpect and Neceſſity, that he was at laſt obliged to ceaſe oppoſing it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould gain nothing but to be blamed for endeavouring to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hinder the Execution of a Deſign which coming from the King his Maſter, had been approved by the General Vote of four Aſſemblies of all the Great Men of the Realm. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Lewis</hi> without taking it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, that he was almoſt the only Perſon in his Kingdom that did not ſeem to approve of this Enterpriſe, did not fail in this occaſion, to do him the greateſt Honor that a King can poſſibly do to a Subject; conferring upon him the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that is, all the Royal Power and Authority during his Abſence. Which makes it evident to Kings and Princes, that though their Sovereign Power diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes with them from any Obligation, always to follow thoſe Counſels which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Prudence they require from their Subjects, and which ought to be given them with all Faithful Sincerity; yet it is great Wiſdom in them to leave their Counſellors at intire Liberty to give their Advice; leſt otherwiſe they give it rather according to the Inclinations of their Prince, than the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own Reaſon, Judgment and Conſcience, which ought to be the Rules of all Faithful and Wiſe Councellors; whereas the other, though they may have been Grateful to their Maſters, and ſometimes advantagious to their Private Intereſts, yet have too frequently proved Fatal to thoſe who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and followed them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Abbot, he having at laſt ſubmitted out of Reſpect and Duty to the Pleaſure
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64918:60"/>of his Maſter in Reference to his Voyage to the Holy Land,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> he made a moſt obſtinate Reſiſtance to that of the Honor of ſo great a Charge; nor would he ever have accepted it, had not the King, as it were to compel him in a manner wholly ſweet and obliging, had the Goodneſs, to have Recourſe to the good Offices, and even the Commands of Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to prevail with him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; for it was in this Year, ſome time after the Convention of the Eſtates at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> that the Pope came into <hi>France,</hi> both to ſecure himſelf from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Revolted <hi>Arnaldiſts,</hi> as alſo there to determine the Differences which were very hot, concerning certain new and Dangerous Propoſitions which were maintained by <hi>Gibert de Porea,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poitiers. Eugenius</hi> was moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably received by the King, and was by the Pope reciprocally received with the Pontifical Benediction in the Church of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> where the Marks of his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the Holy Land, were beſtowed upon him; <hi>Lewis</hi> there deſired the Pope to do him the Honor, during his Abſence to take the Realm into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and the Pope to anſwer that Mark of Piety and Affection towards the Holy See, ſolemnly Excommunicated all thoſe who during the Kings Voyage ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Royal Authority. After which, when the King had made all his Preparations, and had amaſſed great Sums of Mony for the Subſiſtence of his Army, even to the coining of ſeveral Sacred Veſſel belonging to diverſe Churches, and borrowing conſiderable Summs of many Monaſteries with Promiſe of Repayment after the War, he went according to the Cuſtom of his Anceſtors to St. <hi>Dennis</hi> to take the <hi>Oriflame</hi> or Standard of that Saint. From thence he departed a little before Whitſunday towards the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>June,</hi> taking his way for <hi>Mets,</hi> where was to be the general Rendezvous of all his Troops; whileſt in the mean time the Emperor, as before was agreed, marched with his towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they were to rejoyn their Forces.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor accordingly having aſſembled almoſt all the Forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, parted from <hi>Noremberg</hi> about the End of <hi>May,</hi> upon Aſcention Day with a moſt flouriſhing Army, conſiſting in ſeventy Thouſand Men, at Arms all Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiers, without computing the light Horſemen, and with an Infantry the moſt numerous, and in the beſt Condition that ever any Emperor had ſeen before. After having paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Batisbonne,</hi> croſſed through <hi>Auſtria, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Thracia,</hi> without any of thoſe miſchievous Rencounters which happened to the firſt <hi>Cruſades,</hi> upon the ſeventh of <hi>September,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a fair, large and delicious Valley, in the middle whereof ran the River <hi>Melas,</hi> in his Paſſage into the Gulph of that Name or the Black Sea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times borrowing the Name of <hi>Cardia</hi> an Ancient City of the <hi>Thracian Cherſone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> The Beauty of ſo agreeable a place, obliged the Emperor to ſtay there to refreſh his Army, and to Celebrate the Nativity of the Bleſſed Virgin which was the next day. But there happened a ſad Accident, which ſeemed to por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the unlucky Succeſs of this fatal War.</p>
                  <p>For the Army encamping while it was yet Early day, and it happening to be a Serene and Glorious Evening, and the Medows on each ſide of the River exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves a great length to the very Foot of the Mountains, there was nothing during the whole Voyage to be ſeen ſo fair and magnificent as this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment. For the Camp repreſented ſome fair and lofty City, being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of an Infinite Number of very rich Tents, which were diſpoſed in diverſe Streets the whole length of the Plain as far as one could well diſcern, till they came to a little riſing Hill, where ſtood the <hi>Pavilions</hi> of Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like the Cittadel of this Enchanted City. They paſſed the Evening with great Jollity, ſolacing themſelves after the Fatigues of ſo long a March which they had endured a little before they were to go to their Repoſe; after that the Biſhops had begun the Solemnity of the following Feſtival by the Publick Prayers for the Eve of Aſcention, the Heavens began to be darkned with a few ſmall Clouds which produced ſome light Drops rather of Dew than Rain; but within a Moment after there aroſe one of thoſe furious Whirlwinds which they call <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> which made ſuch a diſorder as is not imaginable; for immediately the Impetuoſity of theſe contrary Winds which ruſhed one againſt the other with a moſt dreadful roaring, was ſo great, that having broken all the Cordages which held up the Tents, all this City without Foundation, was partly tumbled
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64918:61"/>down to the Ground,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> and partly hoiſted up into the Air, where the Winds which wrapt themſelves up in the Pavilions, made them ſly about, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tore them in a thouſand pieces; this Storm was ſucceeded by ſuch fearful Deluge of Rain, as made a thouſand litle Torrents come rolling down from the Neighbouring Mountains into the Plain, which by their Rapidity carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them Men, Beaſts, Moveables, and what ever they incountred in their Paſſage; and at the ſame time the South-Wind the moſt violent of the reſt, drove up the Water of the River, and ſwelled it with the Huge Waves of the Sea to that prodigious height, that it overflowed all the Banks in that furious manner, that all the Plain was drowned to the very Foot of the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Tumult, the Conſternation, and the Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Army upon this Terrible Accident; all that the great Lords and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers could do, was to run half naked to their Horſes, to get to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over this new Sea, which had now taken Poſſeſſion of thoſe Beautiful Medows, with which they were before ſo much delighted: As for the poor Foot ſome of them got hold of the Tails of the Horſes, whileſt others quaking with Wet and Cold as well as Fear, followed the Track of the Horſemen; a great many got upon the Waggons as upon a Rampart, and others ſtood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in the Places where they were up to the middle in Water, waiting for the End of this Dreadful Tempeſt; ſome by miſtake falling into the River by reaſon the Banks could not be diſcerned miſerably periſhed in the Waters, and almoſt all loſt the greateſt part of their Baggage. The loſs of men however was not extraordinary in regard that the Tempeſt was too violent to laſt long. The Inundation ceaſed in a few hours, and the Waters falling immediately after, the diſperſed Souldiers rendevouzed upon the Mountain before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who learnt in this Rencontre, how eaſie it is in a Moment for God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the Pride of men, and when he pleaſeth to humble the moſt formidable Powers of the Earth which are weak and miſerable in Compariſon of him. This Prince, who entertained himſelf with theſe Pious and Chriſtian Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, received this Blow of the Hand of Almighty God, with great Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Submiſſion to the Orders of his Providence, and evidenced an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Greatneſs of Soul, and Conſtancy of Mind under this Affliction, thereby to encourage his Army, at the Head of which he continued to march very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; leading them to lodge in the Suburbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there in ſome meaſure to recover this Loſs.</p>
                  <p>In this time a fair Fleet compoſed of above a hundred Sail of <hi>Germans, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Flemings</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which ſeveral private Perſons had rigged out to make their Voyage more eaſily and quickly by Sea, was diverted by an Adventure which was worth more than one <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and in which they happily found in <hi>Europe</hi> all that Glory which they went to ſearch after in <hi>Aſia;</hi> This Fleet ſet Sail from <hi>England</hi> the twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> having on board three or four Thouſand men commanded by their particular Captains. After they had for a long time met with foul Weather and Croſs Winds, at laſt they came to an Anchor before <hi>Lisbon</hi> thinking there to refreſh themſelves; when they were ſurpriſed by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great City beſieged by an Army of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to whom God ſent this unexpected Succour, to take <hi>Lisbon</hi> from the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and to make it the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of that Realm, which a Prince deſcended from the Houſe of <hi>France</hi> had newly founded. This Prince was <hi>Henry</hi> the Grand-Son of <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Second Son of King <hi>Robert.</hi> He being young and a paſſionate Lover of Glory went to ſeek for it in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the Wars againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> towards the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and made his firſt Campagne under that famous Captain <hi>Dom Roderigo de Bivar,</hi> ſo well known in the World under the Glorious Name of <hi>Cid.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he linked himſelf to <hi>Dom Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Leon,</hi> and rendred him ſuch Important Services in both his Fortunes, that that Prince after the Death of his two Brothers <hi>Dom Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Dom Garchia,</hi> ſucceding to all the Eſtates of his Father <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he gave him in Marriage his Daughter <hi>Thereſa,</hi> whom he had by his firſt Wife <hi>Chimena de Guſman.</hi> He himſelf alſo marrying the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Constantia</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and Aunt to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom he alſo gave the City of <hi>Porto,</hi> and ſometime after, all the Eſtate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64918:61"/>which he held in <hi>Portugal,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> which in his Favor he Erected into the Dignity and Title of an Earldom. It is ſaid alſo that he ſent him with the Princes of the firſt <hi>Cruſade</hi> to the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> whereupon all Occaſions he Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized his Courage and his Conduct. But in regard we find no Traces of this Voyage in the Authors, his Contemporaries, who have written very exactly of that War, I think I ought not to Incur any Diſpleaſure, if I give little Credit to ſome of the Hiſtorians of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who upon very weak Conjectures have been pleaſed to Rank among the Heroes of that famous <hi>Cruſade,</hi> the Illuſtrious Head of the Houſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> though he had ſuch a ſufficient Stock of true Glory, as not to ſtand in need of ſearching for that which may with ſo much Juſtice be diſputed.</p>
                  <p>That which he hath which is moſt certain is, that this admirable Earl after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Defeated the <hi>Moors</hi> in ſeventeen pitched Battles, and Conquered from them the greateſt part of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which he added to that which his Father-in-Law had given him in abſolute Soveraignty, he dying left this new Earldom to his Son <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who gloriouſly changed it into a Kingdom. For he was Solemnly proclaimed King in the Field of Battle, at the memorable Day of <hi>Ourique,</hi> where he defeated the Army of five <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings who had Aſſembled againſt him all their Forces, which conſiſted in more than four hundred thouſand Men. The five Kings lay upon the Place Buried in the Heaps of the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their Soldiers, who were piled one upon another; in Memory whereof the new King, who believed that during the Battle he had ſeen Jeſus Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, who promiſed him the Victory, changed the Croſs Azure in the Field Argent, which his Father had taken for his Coat Armor, into five Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coucheons Azure, every one charged with five Beſants Argent in Saltire, to which afterwards was added a Border Gules charged with ſeven Caſtles Or. This is that valiant King Deſcended from a Prince of the moſt Auguſt Houſe of <hi>France,</hi> from whom in a direct Line Male Iſſued the other ſixteen Kings, who Reigned till the time of Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> for ſix Hundred Years in <hi>Portugal,</hi> whoſe Dominions Extended afterwards into three other Parts of the World, <hi>Affrica, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> where the Heroick Piety and Courage of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugeſe,</hi> by finding a new Paſſage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> have Eſtabliſhed the Empire of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as that of their own Nation; and as one of their Rivers having for ſome time hid it ſelf under the Earth, afterwards appears again and runs much greater than before; ſo doth the Illuſtrious Blood of our Kings, which hath ſo long run in the Royal Channel of <hi>Portugal,</hi> at length, after having for more than ſixty Years ceaſed to appear in its natural Place, the Throne of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which it ought to fill, begin in our days to Recover it ſelf with the Applauſe of all the World, in the Perſon of King <hi>John</hi> the Fourth, the Head of the Royal Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who beſides that he Poſſeſſes all the Title of the <hi>Infanta Catharina,</hi> is alſo Deſcended in the direct Maſculin Line, as alſo from that of <hi>John</hi> the Firſt, from whom are Iſſued the laſt Kings unto <hi>Sebaſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was this great <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the Son of Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> and firſt King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who after he had taken <hi>Santaren,</hi> and all the places about <hi>Lisbon,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged that great City, which was Defended by above two hundred thouſand Men. After he had unprofitably ſpent a whole Month in the Siege, having but a few Troops in compariſon of ſuch a Number of Defendants, he began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of his Enterpriſe, when he diſcovered this great Fleet at Sea, which he imagined to be that of the <hi>Affrican</hi> Kings; but he preſently after perceived by the Croſs which they bore in their Flags, that it was a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet. He ſent immediately to be ſatisfied what they were, and upon what Deſign, and being informed that it was a Party of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were going againſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> he went Aboard the Admiral, and propoſed to the Captains the Conqueſt of one of the faireſt Cities in the World, from thoſe Enemies which they were going to Search for in <hi>Syria.</hi> He Remonſtrated to them, That God had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them a fair Occaſion for the preſent Accompliſhment of their Vow, in Combating for the Glory of Chriſt Jeſus, againſt his Enemies, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing themſelves by the Hazard of the Sea, to the Danger of never Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating them at all: That they would acquire more Honor by taking <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of thoſe few <hi>Portugeſes</hi> who Beſieged it, than they could
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64918:62"/>poſſibly hope for,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> by joyning in <hi>Syria</hi> with two ſuch Puiſſant Armies as were thoſe of the Emperor and King of <hi>France,</hi> to which they would be Eſteemed as nothing; and beſides, that the Recompence which they might expect would be incomparably greater, giving them the Word of a King, that they ſhould ſhare the Conqueſt with him. There was no neceſſity for him to ſay more to perſuade People who ſought nothing but Occaſion to Fight againſt the <hi>Saraſins;</hi> they with Joy accepted the Offer of the King, and preſently gave Order for the Diſimbarking of their Troops, and went to take their Poſt upon the <hi>Weſt</hi> Quarter, the King with his Army being already Incamped on the <hi>East</hi> Side of the City, in the place where now ſtands the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Vincent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Attacque was Hot, Furious, and often repeated by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> the Reſiſtance was no ways leſs on the part of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who far ſurpaſſed the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in Number. This made the Siege laſt four Months, till the twenty fifth day of <hi>October,</hi> when the City was in the End taken by Aſſault, all the romainder of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> being put to the Sword, thereby to Extinguiſh that accurſed Race of Men. Thus this new Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was Founded by a <hi>French</hi> Prince, was owing for the glorious Conqueſt of its Capital City, principally to the Valour of the <hi>French</hi> Men, they being the greateſt Number of this Naval Army; for tho there were <hi>Engliſh</hi> and other Nations among them, yet anciently the Title which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> gave indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all Strangers, was that of <hi>French</hi> Men. The King alſo Imployed them in the taking of <hi>Almada, Sintria, Palmela,</hi> and a great many other Places: After which, it being now too late to purſue their Voyage into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the greateſt part of theſe generous <hi>Cruſades,</hi> highly Satisfied with the punctual Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the King, who offered them one half of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> nobly refuſed it, and contenting themſelves with the rich Preſents which the King was pleaſed to make them, Returned loaden with thoſe and Glory into their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; ſome of the moſt remarkable of the Captains being willing to remain in the Service of a King ſo Valiant and Liberal, ſetled in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and there Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe illuſtrious Houſes, which to this very time hold the firſt rank of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in that Kingdom. See now what happy Succeſs befel the ſmalleſt of the three Armies of this ſecond <hi>Cruſade,</hi> whileſt the other two, incomparably the greater in Number, but incomparably the leſs Succeſsful, diſpoſed themſelves to put in Execution their Enterpriſe by Land.</p>
                  <p>For in the ſame time that the Naval Army made Sail upon the Ocean, the young King <hi>Lewis</hi> began to March with his by Land. The Earl of <hi>Morienne,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Monferat,</hi> his two Uncles by the Mother, joyned him at <hi>Mets</hi> with many brave <hi>Italian</hi> Troops; he received alſo a Reinforcement of Troops which were raiſed in <hi>Lorrain</hi> by the Biſhops of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Toul,</hi> by <hi>Renand</hi> Earl of <hi>Monſon,</hi> Brother to the Biſhop of <hi>Metz,</hi> and by <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Vaudemont.</hi> So that this Army Royal was as ſtrong in Cavalry, and much better Mounted and Armed, and not much inferior in Infantry to the Imperial Army, which taking the ſame Way, it Marched to joyn in <hi>Thracia.</hi> But it was Difficult for one ſingle Province to contain ſuch a prodigious Multitude of Valiant Soldiers, which might eaſily have Triumphed over the whole <hi>Eaſt,</hi> if they had been ſufficiently Precautioned as they ought againſt the moſt dangerous Enemy which they had to Encounter, which was the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, whom they took to be their Friend.</p>
                  <p>This Emperor was <hi>Manuel,</hi> the Son of <hi>Calo Johannes,</hi> and Grandchild of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis Comnenius,</hi> who hath rendred his Name ſo Infamouſly Odious by his Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs towards the Princes of the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and who notwithſtanding, never Arrived near the height of that horrible Baſeneſs and Wickedneſs of this his Grandſon, of whom I ſpeak. He was a Prince in whom both his Good and his Evil Qualities were ſo Interwoven, that in the beginning of his Reign, made it doubtful whether he did not deſerve the Empire, of which his Father had Diſinherited his Elder Brother, to beſtow it upon him. For, beſides that the Luſtre of ſome Virtues which he had, ſeemed very well to Conceal his Vices, He was in Perſon very well made, tall, but ſtooping a little, his Face was very Pleaſing, his Colour Lively, his Eyes Sweet and Winning, accompanied with a certain Smile very natural to him, and Charming to thoſe who had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to Approach him, he had Spirit, a natural Eloquence, and a great deal of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64918:62"/>Knowledge; he was beſides Politick and Prudent above his Age,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> which was yet but in the Flower of his Youth, and nevertheleſs Brave, Fearleſs, Hardy, Daring, and ready in the Execution of what he undertook, never conſidering when he ſaw an Enemy, whether he ſhould give Battle or not, and one who not only Loved War, but ſupported the greateſt Toils and Hardſhips of it, with as much Pleaſure as the meaneſt Soldier of Fortune. But all theſe good Qualities were corrupted by his Wickedneſs which far ſurpaſſed them. For in the time of Peace, never was there any Prince more Diſſolute than he in all manner of Debauches, without taking the leaſt Care in the World to preſerve his Reputation by concealing his Vices; for he Lived in moſt, ſcandalous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt with the Princeſs <hi>Theodora</hi> his Niece, with as little Precaution as if ſhe had been his Wife. Beſides he was cruelly Covetous, rapaciouſly taking what he pleaſed, and fottiſhly Prodigal, laviſhing all, even the Mony with which he was to pay his Soldiers and maintain his Navies, giving away his Treaſures without Diſcretion and without Meaſure, to his Niece, to the Eunuchs, and to Strangers, who flattered him in his Brutal Paſſions. He was after all this, infinitely Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and outrageouſly Cruel where he ſuſpected, Superſtitious even to Folly, eſpecially in Judicial Aſtrology, believing in every thing the falſe Oracles of his Figure-Flingers, who Abuſed him to his very Death, promiſing him a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fourteen Years of a moſt delicious and pleaſant Life; but that which is infinitely more Dangerous, he was Raſh and Preſumptuous in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; inſomuch that he commanded by an Edict that a place of Scripture ſhould be Explained in his Senſe, which clearly gave it for the Hereſy of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> at another time he put out a Decree, which openly favoured the falſe Law of the Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But in ſhort, that of his deviliſh Qualities which was moſt eminent in him, was his Perſidiouſneſs, which made him commit the blackeſt and moſt horrid Crimes upon the Occaſion of this ſecond <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which have rendred his Memory eternally Execrable to the whole Earth.</p>
                  <p>He received at the firſt the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Conrade</hi> indifferently well, they coming from his Brother-in-Law; for theſe two Emperors had married two Siſters, the Daughters of old <hi>Berengarius</hi> Earl of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> and <hi>Sultzbach;</hi> He alſo ſent ſome Troops to meet the Emperor, not ſo much out of Reſpect or Honor, but to obſerve his Motion during the remainder of his March to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where at his Arrival he was but very coldly Received; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Manuel</hi> could not without ſome Diſpleaſure ſee a Prince who took upon him that Quality, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend appertained only to their Emperor; or that he feared that the <hi>Germans,</hi> who had had great Differences upon the March with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſhould indeavour to Revenge themſelves; or rather that he was reſolved to Execute what he had plotted againſt them, as ſoon as he could poſſibly. In ſhort, he did ſo violently preſs their Departure, that without giving them the Liberty almoſt of taking Breath, the Army was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to paſs the <hi>Strait,</hi> upon the Veſſels which he had ready to waft them over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where this perfidious Emperor had long before diſpoſed all things for the ruine of this Army. For ſo ſoon as he underſtood that great Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were making in the <hi>Weſt</hi> for this ſecond <hi>Cruſade,</hi> he ſecretly gave Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to <hi>Mamut</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Soliman</hi> the Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> who Reigned in <hi>Lycaonia, Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and preſſed him vigorouſly to take up Arms againſt this Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> which he was like to have upon his Hands. Whereupon the Sultan, immediately ſent to all the Princes of his Nation, to come for their common Intereſt, with all the Forces they could raiſe, to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him againſt the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which they did before one could well think it poſſible, ſending him a moſt formidable Army, compoſed of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Turks</hi> of the two <hi>Armenia's, Cappadocia, Iſauria, Cilicia, Perſia</hi> and <hi>Media.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this was not all, for this perfidious Emperor, laid of his own Soldiers continual Ambuſcades within his Territories, on both ſides of the Army in their March, commanding them to Kill, as they did without Mercy, all thoſe who ſtraggled never ſo little from the Body of the Army, which for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not being able to march at any Compaſs, ſuffered extremely for want of Proviſions. Not contented with this, having promiſed the Emperor to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64918:63"/>his Troops with Proviſions for their Money,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> he gave order underhand, by a curſed piece of Wickedneſs, to mingle Quick-lime among their Flower, which was to make Bread for the Soldiers; which brought a ſtrange Mortality among the poor <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe extream Hunger would not permit them to perceive the cruel Cheat; for they greedily devoured theſe poyſoned Morſels, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Importunity of their ſtarved Appetites; and ſo miſerably periſhed. He cauſed the Gates of all the Towns in their Paſſage to be ſhut againſt them, not permitting any of them to enter, to buy Proviſion; but if they would have any, the <hi>Greeks</hi> upon the Walls would tell them, they would furniſh them for their Money, provided they firſt received it by Baskets which they let down to them from the Walls; and then the treacherous Villains, as if they had been inſpired by their perfidious Emperor, returned only Deriſion, inſtead of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, in exchange for their Silver. If at any time they were, as many were, conſtrained to ſell ſome part of their Equipage, to get Subſiſtence, they gave them, who underſtood nothing of their Coins, falſe Money inſtead of current; which, when they went to buy for their neceſſity, would not paſs in Payment. In ſhort, there was no ſort of Miſchief, which this faithleſs Prince, who had no ſparks of Honour or common Honeſty left, did not invent and execute, for the deſtruction of this Army.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt deteſtable of all his Treaſons, and that which compleated their entire Ruin was, that he gave them Traytors for their Guides and Conductors, who were reſolved to deliver them into the hands of the <hi>Turks.</hi> There are two Ways by which one may go to <hi>Antioch;</hi> the one upon the Left, the ſhorter, but more difficult and dangerous, by reaſon of the Deſerts, and the Mountains, which muſt be paſſed, in going through thoſe more In-land Countries, which lie remote from the Sea: the other Way lay upon the Right Hand, and was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about, following all along by the Sea-Coaſt; but withal, this was the moſt ſecure, and moſt plentiful for the Subſiſtence of the Army. When they were arrived at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> it was taken into Deliberation, what Courſe, of theſe two, they ſhould take: <hi>Otho,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Friburg,</hi> and ſome others of the wiſer ſort, were of Opinion, that they ſhould take the way by the Sea, as the moſt ſafe; eſpecially, ſince they could not reſolve to rely upon the Faith of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in their Paſſage in an unknown Country: but the Emperor, who deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to ſight with the <hi>Turks,</hi> believing that all <hi>Aſia,</hi> if it were together, was not able to reſiſt him, would follow his Guides, who promiſed, in a few days, to bring him into <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> a moſt fertile Country, and abounding with all things; and even to <hi>Iconium,</hi> where, they aſſured him, the Sultan would never have the Confidence to ſtay for his Coming.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing that, in probability, can be more conducing to the Ruin of the braveſt Army, than the Preſumption of their General; who, believing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf invincible, does not take thoſe Precautions, and thoſe Meaſures, without which, the Greatneſs of his Forces ſerve to no other purpoſe, but more eaſily to occaſion their Ruin. <hi>Conrad,</hi> puft up with the Glory of ſuch a flouriſhing Army, as none of his Predeceſſors had ever commanded, loſt his Judgment, to that degree, that he could not ſee, what every common Man of Senſe muſt needs know, that it is impoſſible, without extream Imprudence, and running the moſt dangerous Riſque in the World, to truſt to the good or ill Faith of two or three unknown Perſons; and thereby make them abſolute Maſters, both of his own Fortune, and that of his whole Army. Upon the matter, he was ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that theſe Traytors having aſſured him, as he lay encamped near <hi>Nice,</hi> that there was no neceſſity of taking along with him more than eight days Proviſion, for that in that time they would not fail to bring him to <hi>Iconium:</hi> So that he ſuffered himſelf to be conducted, with all his great Army, in its magnificent Pomp, like a Victim crowned with Flowry Garlands, to have its Throat cut upon the Altar. For the eight days being paſt, they perceived that the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, inſtead of taking the Right Hand, to conduct the Army into <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> had taken the Left, to engage them inſenſibly in the Deſerts, and the Straits of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> towards <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> where they found themſelves without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, or the hopes of procuring any, in a Country ſo frightfully barren, that it had no other Inhabitants but Bears, Tigers, Lyons, Wolves, and other wild
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64918:63"/>Beaſts, who dwelt among the Rocks and Mountains. The Emperor,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find himſelf in this terrible danger, commanded the Guides to be brought before him, where he reproached them ſeverely: to which the perfidious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains anſwered coldly, that they were not too blame, for they thought that the Army would have taken longer Marches; but they aſſured him, with horrible Oaths, that, provided they would make a little more haſte, they ſhould, within three days, arrive in a moſt plentiful Country.</p>
                  <p>It is ſome pain to believe there ſhould be ſo injudicious a Conduct in a Prince, to whom his Age, and Acquaintance with the World, ought to have given more Experience: for, inſtead of ſecuring theſe Cheats, whoſe Credit ought to have been, after this, very much ſuſpected, he left them at liberty to eſcape, as they did the Night following, and ran over the Mountains, to the Camp of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who daily expected them, to take their Meaſures accordingly. And thereupon they did not fail, immediately to appear on all ſides, upon the Rocks, and the Tops of the Mountains, to inveſt this Army, which was now reduced to live upon the Fleſh of their Horſes, and know not what Reſolution to take; whether to retreat, or to advance. Never was there ſeen ſo piteous an Overthrow of ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant an Army. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who knew the Country, and who were lightly armed, flew about with eaſe, and without danger, on every ſide aſſailing theſe poor Troops, half defeated with Famine, and heavily armed, and who could not be aſſiſted by thoſe few Horſe that were left, who were able to do little Service among the craggy and impaſſable Mountains. So the Infidels, who never came nearer than within the diſtance of their Bows, without fear of Lance, Sword, or theſe cutting Arms, which were of no uſe to thoſe who carried them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, with a Certainty of hitting, and at their pleaſure, a moſt dreadful Cloud of Arrows upon that great Multitude, and then retired, without ſearing a Purſuit from the half-diſmounted Cavalry: Within a Moment they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, to make another Diſcharge upon theſe poor People, at whom they ſhot, from the higher Ground, to the lower, as at a Butt; they, in the mean time, being neither able to defend themſelves, nor revenge their death. So that, without the Expence of one Man to the <hi>Turk,</hi> the poor <hi>Conrade,</hi> who himſelf was wounded, though but ſlightly, with two Arrows, was compelled to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all his Baggage, the Dead and Dying, the Sick, and the greateſt part of his Infantry to the Mercy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who killed a great number, and carried the reſt into miſerable Slavery; the Emperor himſelf, with great difficulty, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, not with above the tenth part of his Army, retired to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, which was now advanced as far as <hi>Nice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For while the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> marched before, and was making this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Voyage, the King, after having taken a Review of his Army at <hi>Metz,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Wormes,</hi> the 29th of <hi>June,</hi> where he was moſt magnificently entertained; and the <hi>Danube,</hi> at <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> from whence he marched to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and ſo through <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> without any moleſtation: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once entred upon the Territories of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, he found, oftner than once, the perfidiouſneſs of that unworthy Prince; who had given under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Orders to all his Officers, to do him all the miſchief which poſſibly they could do in his Paſſage. He did the ſame alſo himſelf, to the Ambaſſadors which the King had ſent, accompanied with a conſiderable number of the <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; who received a thouſand Affronts and Diſpleaſures, at the ſame time that this diſ-loyal Man made them a thouſand Proteſtations of Amity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The King, however, who was reſolute to purſue his firſt Deſign, and who, with caſe, defeated the Troops which endeavoured to oppoſe his Paſſage, diſſembling theſe Injuries, though ſome there were, who counſelled him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he being much ſtronger than the Emperor. In Concluſion, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>October,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where <hi>Manuel,</hi> who knew his own Guilt, and was in mighty fear of ſuch a formidable Power, as he was in no poſſibility of reſiſting, received him with all the Reſpects and Honours ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
                  <p>All the Great Perſons of the Empire, the Patriarch, with the whole Clergy, and all the ſeveral Companies of the City, went out to meet him; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf, cloathed in his Imperial Robes, received him at the Gate of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64918:64"/>great Palace.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> The meeting of theſe two Princes was, certainly, a very great and extraordinary Appearance: they were both about the ſame Years, being near twenty eight; both of them of a Majeſtick Compoſure, admirably well ſhaped, and of noble Preſence, and both of them moſt magnificently habited, though after a different manner: and as they both knew, admirably well, how to diſſemble; the one, by Nature and Malice; the other, by Art and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there was not the leaſt Punctilio of Reſpect, Tenderneſs and Affection, which they did not, upon this occaſion, reciprocally beſtow, one upon the other; They embraced, they kiſſed, and entertained each other, by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, for a long time, in the Emperor's Chamber, environed with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lords of the one and the other Nation: And the Emperor, after he had given the King a thouſand Praiſes upon the Subject of his glorious Enterprize, and had wiſhed him all manner of proſperous Succeſs, offering to ſerve him with all that ever he had, his Forces and Eſtate, he made him be conducted by all the great Lords of the Empire, to the Palace, which was moſt magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared for him. The next Day, he accompanied him to the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> and the other moſt celebrated Churches, which the King had a mind to viſit: after which, he treated him at an Entertainment, where the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Preparations, the ſumptuous, rich and admirable Variety, accompanied with all the uſual Attendants of Rejoycing, ſurpaſſed all that ever had been done by his Predeceſſors, in their moſt ſplendid Receptions of other Princes and Kings. He himſelf alſo ordered, that ſo he might ſatisfie the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, that the Feſtival of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> the Apoſtle of <hi>France,</hi> whom the <hi>Greek</hi> Church acknowledged, as well as the <hi>Latin,</hi> ſhould be celebrated with a moſt extraordinary Pomp; cauſing the Divine Offices to be performed with all the moſt Ceremonious Solemnity, and moſt admirable Muſick; which, to the <hi>French,</hi> who are naturally Lovers of Novelties, was moſt pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. In ſhort, he did all that poſſibly he could, to pleaſe the King; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him ſuch ſmooth and obliging things, and framing his Countenance, his Eyes, his Geſtures, and all his Actions, into ſo perfect a Harmony and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of extream Joy and Satisfaction, that the greateſt part of the Lords, who judged the depth of his heart by theſe deluding Appearances, which lay uppermoſt upon his Actions, were perſuaded, that he acted moſt ſincerely, and loved the King with all his heart.</p>
                  <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Langreſs,</hi> who was a Man of wonderful Prudence, and who obſerved every thing with a curious eye, eaſily perceived that all this was Artifice; and that under all theſe affected Teſtimonies of a feigned Amity, there lay hid ſome dangerous Treaſon, which ought, by ſome generous Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to be prevented, by putting the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the mortal Enemies of the <hi>French,</hi> out of the capacity of doing them any miſchief. Upon the Debate, therefore, of the Council, which was holden to deliberate concerning the March of the Army, which the Emperor preſſed with a great deal of Heat and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; when it came to the Biſhop's ſhare to ſpeak, he gave advice, which, if it had been followed as warmly, as it was ſlighted imprudently, had in a few days, put a period to the War, to the immortal Glory of the <hi>French,</hi> as well as to the univerſal Good of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> For he ſaid that, In his Opinion, it was neither convenient for the King to ſtay there any long time, to attend the coming up of the Troops which were expected from <hi>Italy;</hi> nor yet, according to the ſenſe of others, to be ſo haſty to paſs the Strait, to joyn with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> but that in his Judgment, the King ought to lay hold on that fair Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which God Almighty ſeemed to preſent him, and to ſtrike the laſt, and the great Blow to that <hi>Holy War,</hi> by making himſelf Maſter of <hi>Conſtantinople. This, Sir,</hi> added he, <hi>is the only, abſolute, and neceſſary way for Your Majeſty, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to finiſh this War, to aſſure the Conqueſts in the Eaſt, and to make new ones, by repulſing, to the remoteſt Confines of</hi> Perſia, <hi>thoſe Infidels who now diſpute with us the Poſſeſſion of</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>and of</hi> Syria. <hi>For, moſt certainly, ſo long as we leave</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople <hi>behind us, in the hands of the perfidious</hi> Manuel, <hi>we are aſſured there of a moſt potent and treacherous Enemy; who will not fail to cut off from us all Re-inforcements of men, and all Supplies of Proviſion; without which, it is impoſſible for Armies to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: and who will do more towards our Deſtruction, by his ſecret Correſpondencies and

<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> The implacable, the ineconciliable Hatred which this perfidious Nation have entertained againſt us, is too frequently, and too loudly proclaimed, to permit us to repoſe the leaſt Confidence in them; Nor does it now ſleep under theſe ſlight Appearances of Amity, but out of pure fear of the Power of our Arms; and ſo ſoon as they ſhall ſee themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from thoſe uneaſie Fetters, we ſhall find the ſame Effects, which others before us have felt and found from ſo many horrible Treaſons of theſe</hi> Greeks, <hi>who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſenſe of Honour or Honeſty, or any manner of regard to the Dictates of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, or good Conſcience. Their Intentions are moſt evident; and</hi> Manuel <hi>makes it very clearly appear, that he intends, not only to tread in the ſteps of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Father and Grandfather, but to out-do them; ſince he hath had the Confidence to demand of the</hi> French <hi>Nobility, that they ſhould do him Homage, even in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Your Majeſty. Let us therefore, once for all, remove this dangerous Obſtacle of our Conqueſts: Let us, by one generous Blow, aſſure our ſelves, both of the Freedom of Paſſage, and of all the Cities of this Empire, both in</hi> Europe <hi>and</hi> Aſia, <hi>which will, doubtleſs, follow the Fortune of this Capital City: And let us not, by a fooliſh Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity, ſpare an Enemy, who will never ceaſe to employ all the blackeſt Contrivances of a miſchievous Mind, to ruin and deſtroy us. It ever was, and ever will be lawful, to prevent our own, by his Ruin, who hath contrived ours: And were there nothing elſe, the repeated Attempts of his Troops, and the Baſeneſs of his People towards us, in our Paſſage hither, which, doubtleſs, was by his ſecret Orders, ſo contrary to the Faith they had given us, and for which that diſ-loyal Man will not make the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, are ſufficient to legitimate the Vengeance which we ought to take upon him and his perfidious People. In ſhort, Since this holy War which we have undertaken is juſt, it is alſo juſt to make uſe of thoſe Ways and Means which are abſolutely neceſſary to make it ſucceſsful; and that, nothing can aſſure us, but the Taking of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>And to me it appears, the Voice of God, who himſelf ſeems to call us to it; and, by opening the Gates of this City to us, to give us an eaſie Conqueſt over it: for we have nothing more to do, but to cut off their Water, by breaking the Conduits, and ſlopping thoſe proud Aqueducts which ſupply them therewith: Or if we be obliged to make uſe of Force, their Fortifications are all ruinous, the Towers half demoliſhed to our hands, the Ditches almoſt filled and grown up, the Walls weak and defenceleſs, and, for the moſt part, ready to fall before our Faces; as if God, without the help of Engines, had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undertaken to make Breaches, large enough in all reaſon for us to enter; which we may do without Reſiſtance, ſince we have, not only one of the braveſt Armies that ever yet were ſeen, but that alſo theſe pitiful</hi> Greeks, <hi>with whom we have to do, are moſt miſerable Cowards, without Conduct, without Experience in War, and abandoned of God, for their Schiſm, Hereſie, and horrible Perfidiouſneſs and Impieties. For which Reaſons, Sir, I argue, that before we advance any further in the Purſuit of the great End which Your Majeſty hath propoſed, we ought to take this Way, and this Means, which will conduct us to it, and which does not only appear of abſolute neceſſity, but highly juſt, and equally eaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe of the Biſhop was diverſly received in the Council: Some of the Wiſeſt approved it, but it was contradicted by the Majority, rather out of a vain Scrupuloſity, than any manner of Reaſon which they had to oppoſe it. They confeſſed indeed, that it was a very eaſie matter to take <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and at the ſame time, they could not deny but there was all the Juſtice and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World to do it: but, on the other hand they alledged, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken this War out of pure Devotion, by their Arms to deliver the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the Oppreſſion of the Infidels, they could not accompliſh their Vow, and, by Conſequence, have no hope of the Remiſſion of their Sins, if they ſhould chance to dye in ſighting againſt Chriſtians, and taking their Cities from them. All this while never conſidering what the Biſhop had ſo well remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, That he who will moſt certainly attain the End which he propoſes, muſt make uſe of ſuch Means as, provided they be lawful, are moſt neceſſary and conducing to it; and that, who endeavouring the one, does the other, muſt of neceſſity, lay a Claim to the ſame proportion of Merits. But thus it is; When once a groundleſs Scruple, under the ſpecious name of Religion, hath fixed it ſelf in the Minds of Men, it becomes ſo abſolutely Maſter, and is defended with ſo much Obſtinacy, that good Senſe and Reaſon, and that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64918:65"/>natural Right which God hath given to Man,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> for his Conduct in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of either publick or private Affairs, cannot come ſo much as to obtain a fair Hearing.</p>
                  <p>But however, when it was too late, they afterwards found their mighty Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in not following this Judicious Counſel. The crafty <hi>Greeks,</hi> that ſo they might haſten away the King into <hi>Aſia,</hi> by giving a Jealouſie to the <hi>French,</hi> whom they knew to be extream amorous of Glory, ſpread a malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the <hi>Germans</hi> had already taken <hi>Iconium,</hi> and given Chace to the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, who fled before them. At this the whole Army preſently took fire to that degree, that, what with their Murmurings, and what with their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Cries, they conſtrained the King to paſs over into <hi>Aſia</hi> upon the Veſſels of the Emperor, which lay ready for that purpoſe; and no ſooner did he ſee the greateſt part of them on the other ſide, but he threw off the Mask: For, upon pretext of ſome particular Diſorders, committed by a private Soldier, who had taken ſome Merchandize without paying for it, he took occaſion to ſtop and pillage all the <hi>French</hi> that were behind at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And though the King had commanded inſtant Juſtice to be done upon the Criminal, yet he thereupon abſolutely prohibited his Subjects from carrying any manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to the Army. And ſo fierce and furious was he now grown on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, knowing that their Dependance was ſo great upon him, that it was not without great difficulty that he was appeaſed: And at the laſt, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the generous Remonſtrances of the Biſhop of <hi>Langreſs,</hi> not until there was a new Treaty concluded, by which the King engaged, that he would take neither Town nor Caſtle from him, and that the <hi>French</hi> Princes ſhould do him the ſame Homage which the Princes of the firſt <hi>Cruſade</hi> had done to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Alexis: Manuel,</hi> for his part, promiſing to furniſh the King with three or four <hi>Greek</hi> Noblemen, who had Skill to conduct his Army by good Ways; and that he would furniſh Magazines of Proviſions for them, during their March.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Lords, who were ready to dye with the deſire they had to make haſte, to have their ſhare in the good Fortune, and the Glory, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the <hi>German</hi> Army were now reaping, made no ſort of difficulty to make that Oath to the Emperor; ſaying, That they did the ſame every day, in <hi>France,</hi> to the Lords of Fieffs, without any prejudice to the Sovereignty of the King. But the Count <hi>de Dreux,</hi> the King's Brother, believing that he ſhould diſhonour the Blood of <hi>France,</hi> if he ſhould acknowledge for his Lord, any one, except the King his Brother, took occaſion to give them the ſlip; taking along with him ſome of the moſt Generous, as alſo the Princeſs, his Couſin, whom <hi>Manuel</hi> deſired for a Wife for one of his Nephews: And while they were hotly diſputing about theſe two Articles, which the Biſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> ever moſt vigorouſly oppoſed, he had Leiſure enough to get as far as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia.</hi> At the ſame time, the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who made War with <hi>Manuel,</hi> with Succeſs enough, did whatever he was able, by his Ambaſſadors, to oblige the King to joyn with him, in a League againſt that Emperor, and to attack him, both by Sea and Land, in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in <hi>Aſia.</hi> But the Scruple which the King had ſtill in his Mind, which made him fearful of violating his Vow, if he ſhould make never ſo little a Sally from this Holy War, made him refuſe all theſe fair Offers, contrary to the Advice of the wiſe Biſhop of <hi>Langreſs;</hi> who clearly fore-ſaw, and to no purpoſe fore-told, the Misfortunes which would befall him and the Army, by the Perfidiouſneſs of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor. Thus the Treaty being concluded, and the Emperor, after an Interview with the King, upon the Banks of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> having ſent over all the <hi>French</hi> that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the whole Army marched, in the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> towards <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> a City which, at that time was, in a manner, wholly ruinous.</p>
                  <p>And now the Baſeneſs and Treachery of the perfidious <hi>Manuel</hi> began plainly to appear; for the Guides and Officers which he promiſed to ſend, to conduct the Army through a good Country, and to give Orders for Proviſions, were not to be found; and in the Road wherein they now were, there was very little Subſiſtence for the Army: ſo that it was reſolved to change it; and quitting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64918:65"/>the leſt Hand where the Provinces were very barren and deſolate,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> to take the Right Hand way towards the South, and to incamp upon the Lake of <hi>Aſcanius</hi> near unto <hi>Nice.</hi> There it was, that in the Heat of thoſe Deſires which poſſeſſed the Army to advance, and joyn as ſoon as poſſible with the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were ſuppoſed to be ſo victorious, they were extremely ſurprized with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Defeat. At firſt the news came but by ſome whiſpering Rumors, but it was in a little time confirmed by <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia</hi> the Emperors Nephew, whom that unfortunate Prince, who with great difficulty had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Nice,</hi> with the pittiful Remainder of his ruined Army, who in their Extremity were very ill treated alſo by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> had ſent to the King to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe him of his overthrow, and to requeſt of him that he might ſee him, to the End that from his diſaſter he might give him Notice of ſome things of great Importance in this unhappy Conjuncture. The King who certainly was a Prince the moſt Civil and Obliging in the World, and had a Soul of the beſt Temper of any man of his time, reſolved inſtantly to prevent the Emperor in his Deſign of ſeeing him, and to endeavour to ſweeten his ill Fortune by all manner of Honors and good Offices which he was capable to do him; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately mounted to Horſe, accompanied with all the great Lords and Officers of his Army, and went to find the Emperor in the Place where he was encamped, expecting the Return of his Nephew <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was there any thing ſeen more Tender and Moving than this Enterview; for no ſooner did theſe two great Princes ſee each other, but they ran into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Embraces, wherein they held one the other for a long time, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſpeak any other Language, but thoſe Tears which the Joy, the Grief and Compaſſion, which moved ſo diverſly in their Hearts, drew at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Eyes. The King was the firſt who broke the Silence, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to force a Joy into his Lips, in Deſpite of the Sorrow which ſurrounded his Heart, he ſaid all that it was poſſible in the moſt Chriſtian and obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to comfort the Afflicted Emperor for his Loſs; he offered him all that he had, his Forces and his Fortune, and proteſted, that he always would eſteem it as great an Honor to be his Faithful Companion in this War, as he ſhould have done were he ſtill at the Head of an Army, as numerous and flouriſhing as that which he commanded before this Diſaſter. The Emperor alſo on his part, ſaid all that was moſt capable to touch the Heart of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged with great Humility, the Heavy hand of God to be juſtly laid upon him for the Sins of his Army, and for his own too great Preſumption, in relying ſo much upon the Strength of his own Arms, to the Prejudice of that Confidence which he ought to have repoſed in God alone, in whoſe Almighty Hands is the Diſpoſal of the Fortunes of Kings. Nevertheleſs, he ſaid, ſince God had been pleaſed ſtill to give him the ſame Ardent Deſire to accompliſh his Vow, and that he had in his Extremity found out for him ſuch a Generous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, he hoped that his Divine Majeſty would be pleaſed yet to make uſe of him to combat the Infidels among the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> which he hoped would be happier than his, and that he was reſolved never to part from them. After which the two Princes having held a great Councel with the Principal Lords of the one and the other Nation, it was reſolved that the two Armies ſhould march together, following the Road which the King had already taken, in drawing toward the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> between the Sea and <hi>Phrygia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Reſolution of the Emperor did not continue long; for the <hi>German</hi> Lords ſome or other of them every day demanding of him leave to depart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretext that they had loſt their Equipage, when they were arrived at the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> after having ſuffered much by the miſchievous <hi>Greeks,</hi> this poor Prince found himſelf ſo ſlenderly accompanied that he was aſhamed of himſelf; and believing that it was putting an Affront upon his own Character, and the Empire which he governed, to have it ſaid that an Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> without an Army ſhould ſeem to ſerve under a King of <hi>France,</hi> he therefore Excuſed himſelf in the beſt manner that he could to the King, and ſending away the little Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Infantry by Land, himſelf with a few Noblemen who yet attended him, took the Opportunity of the Return of the <hi>Greek</hi> Ambaſſadors who had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64918:66"/>followed the King to <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1147</label> and went by Sea to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where his miſerable Fortune which intituled him to pity, procured a better Reception for him from his Brother in Law the Emperor, than he found in his more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Condition to whom the Attendance of a flouriſhing Army which he had before, gave ſo much Occaſion of Fear and Jealouſie: So Great is the Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Humane Nature, that it is a Pleaſure to ſee men become unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>As for the Ambaſſadors which <hi>Manuel</hi> had ſent to the King to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> they only ſeved more to manifeſt the baſe Perfidy and Malice of this Emperor, their Buſineſs was only to preſent the King with Letters from their Maſter, by which he advertized the King, that he was like to have upon his Hands ſuch an innumerable Company of <hi>Turks</hi> that it was impoſſible for him to reſiſt them; and therefore he adviſed him to ſecure himſelf from ſo furious a Tempeſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into ſome Places within his Empire where he might be in ſafety. The King who eaſily diſcovered the Malice of that wicked Prince, whoſe Deſign was to ſtop his further Progreſs, and by obliging him to divide his Troops to weaken himſelf in ſuch ſort, as that he might become an eaſie Prey to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly anſwered the Ambaſſadors, That as he did not in the leaſt Degree ſtand in Fear of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo he ſtood in no Neceſſity of the Favour which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror their Maſter pretended to do him, and that he was fully reſolved to purſue his Enterpriſe. Whereupon the Ambaſſadors, according to the Orders which they had received, ſeeing they had unprofitably ſpent the other fooliſh Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fear, preſented the King with other Letters, by which that Emperor diſcovered more plainly his Malicious Will; for therein he complained migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily of the Diſorders which he ſaid the Kings Army committed in his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and with a kind of Menace gave him to underſtand, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him hereafter to prevent his Subjects from taking Vengeance upon them upon all Occaſions that ſhould offer. To this the King who amidſt all the Goodneſs of his Natural Diſpoſition, ever retained a certain Air and Character of Greatneſs, and a Noble Fierceneſs, worthy of the Greateſt of all Kings, made no other Anſwer than by a Geſture of Diſdain, by a ſhort turn Leaving the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to carry that Account, for he would ſend no other, to their Maſter: leaving <hi>Epheſus</hi> therefore which at that time was almoſt nothing but a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heap of Ruins, he went to paſs the Feaſts at Chriſtmaſs in the open Fields in that fair and delicious Valley where now the reſt of that City is ſituate. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtmaſs he quitted the Sea-Coaſt, and advanced more within Land to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, drawing right toward <hi>Laodicea</hi> a City of <hi>Lydia</hi> between <hi>Tralla</hi> and <hi>Apamia,</hi> upon the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> where it goes to loſe it ſelf in that of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> upon the Banks whereof all the Army went to encamp in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the following Year.</p>
                  <p>The River of <hi>Meander</hi> ſo celebrated by the Songs of the Poets, for the ſinging of her Swans, of which they have there created great Numbers, which never mortal man could yet find, is one of the faireſt Rivers of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and which in its Courſe waters more Countries than all the others; for it hath ſo many ſeveral Windings and Turnings, that it is ſaid between the Head of its Spring, and its Fall into the Sea it makes ſix hundred Semicircles. It riſes out of a Fountain ſometimes called <hi>Aulocrene,</hi> at the Foot of the Mount <hi>Selenus</hi> in the greater <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and after having moiſtened that fair Province, it turns from the Eaſt to the Weſt running between the Mountains and the Hills, through thoſe rich and ſpacious Vallies and delightful Medows, which on the right Hand divide <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Ionia</hi> from <hi>Caria,</hi> whoſe <hi>Boundary</hi> it is on the left Hand, till it falls into the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, between the Cities of <hi>Miletus</hi> and <hi>Priena.</hi> When the Army was arrived to the Banks of this famous River, it was reſolved to ſtay there to refreſh themſelves for a few days in that place, which is one of the richeſt and moſt delightful Countries of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> But they were no ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, but they perceived that the <hi>Turks</hi> had poſted themſelves moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly upon the Mountains which lye on both ſides of the River. For the <hi>Infidels</hi> had learnt by their <hi>Greek</hi> Spies, who gave them conſtant Intelligence, that the <hi>French</hi> marching from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> took the way for <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which lies on the further ſide of <hi>Meander;</hi> and there they imagined they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat them with great advantage, and defeat them without difficulty in their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64918:66"/>paſſage over the River.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> For this purpoſe therefore they divided their Army into two Parts; poſſeſſing themſelves of all the Heights on both ſides of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that when the <hi>French</hi> Army ſhould attempt to paſs it, the one ſhould fall in upon their Rere, at the ſame time that the others being poſted on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bank, ſhould oppoſe the Van in their Endeavours to paſs over, and in Caſe either of them found themſelves preſſed, they ſhould retire to the Mountains which were at no great diſtance from them.</p>
                  <p>The King preſently apprehended their Deſign, and finding no Poſſibility of paſſing it in that place where he was encamped, by reaſon the River was too deep and large, reſolved to paſs up higher towards <hi>Laodicea;</hi> and to ſecure his March, he placed the Baggage and all that was feeble in the middle, ranging his beſt Troops in the Rere, and on his left towards the Mountains; for he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to be attacked either in the Front, or on that ſide where the River ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated him from the Enemies who marched over againſt him to impeach his Paſſage. In this Condition he marched ſome time, but could make no manner of Progreſs, becauſe he was continually obliged to make Halts, to repulſe the Enemies who perpetually followed the Army, coming to make a Diſcharge with their Arrows without coming nearer, and then wheeling off at full Speed; immediately returning in the ſame manner without ever coming to handy Blows. So that the ſecond day, ſeeing that he could neither ſight, nor march at quiet, he ſtopt ſhort about Noon, and reſolved to attempt the Paſs in the View of both the Armies who obſerved his Motions.</p>
                  <p>In Truth it was a brave and Generous Reſolution, but extreme difficult in the Execution; for the <hi>Meander</hi> though it be not very Rapid by Reaſon of its many Windings, yet it is very broad and deep. It was in the Month of <hi>January</hi> when Rivers uſually are at the biggeſt, and it had now rained for four days in ſuch abundance, that its Waters were conſiderably increaſed; there was one Army at his Back, and another appeared drawn up in <hi>Batallia</hi> upon the further Bank, and in the Plain whither it was deſcended to defend the Paſs; and if the Entry into the River was eaſie the getting out was difficult, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bank being not only poſſeſſed by the Enemies, but very ſteep and high; and that which made the Difficulty greater was, that there was not one fordable place to be found, all the Country People though ſeveral Examined agreeing in the Proteſtation that they never knew any paſſing there. And beſides all this, ſo ſoon as any of the Soldiers entred the River to ſearch for a Ford, the <hi>Turks</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide alſo entred the River, and ſhowred down their Arrows upon them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Deſire which the Army had to paſs and fight the Infidels was ſo great, that after having tried both above and below to find out a Ford in the River, without regarding the Arrows of the Enemies, they at the laſt found one, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a little upon the left hand, which thoſe of the Country had never known.</p>
                  <p>The King after he had given Orders to the Cavalry of the Avant-Guard to paſs the Ford, he put himſelf at the Head of the Rere, which faced the <hi>Turks</hi> who had charged them there, and running upon them at a full Cariere before they had the Liberty according to their Cuſtom to retire, he cut a great part of them in pieces, and repulſed the reſt with Sword and Lance at their very Reins, even to the Mountains. At the ſame time <hi>Thierri</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders, Henry</hi> the Son of <hi>Thibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earl <hi>de Maſcon,</hi> having thrown themſelves with the firſt Squadrons into the River, were followed by all the reſt, and in Deſpight of the Arrows which like Hail were ſhowred moſt furiouſly upon them from the oppoſite Bank, which did but little Execution upon thoſe armed Troops, they gained the other Shoar, and ſuſtained the Shock of their Enemies, till the reſt of the Troops got over and drew up in <hi>Batalia.</hi> Immediately thereupon they made a moſt furious Charge upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> who now no longer able to uſe their Bows were preſently overthrown; for theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> having no defenſive Arms, and not accuſtomed to fight Foot to Foot againſt the <hi>Franks,</hi> were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give way to that Terrible Shock, and therefore betook themſelves to Flight, leaving a great Number of their Men extended upon the Earth, and a great many of Priſoners; the reſt were purſued to the Mountains where
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64918:67"/>they ſaved themſelves,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> but the Camp which they had pitched in the Plain, fell to the Share of the Soldiers; thus the whole Army having now no more Enemy neither in Front or Rear which durſt appear, paſſed the River with Eaſe, ſome behind the Horſe, others upon the Wagons and Planks of Timber.</p>
                  <p>There ran a Report in the Army, that a Cavalier in white Arms, who was never ſeen before nor after, paſſing before the reſt as it were to ſhew them the Way they were to take, gave the firſt Charge upon the Squadrons of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But as it was the Humour of thoſe times to feign ſuch Viſions, to render extraordinary Actions as this was, more miraculous, one may without ſcruple diſpenſe with disbelieving this Apparition. <hi>Eudes</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> who was the Succeſſor of <hi>Sugerius,</hi> and who was by that great Abbot recommended to the King as an able Man to ſerve him, both as his Chaplain and his Secretary, during that Voyage ſatisfies himſelf with ſaying, that there were ſeveral who affirmed they ſaw that white Cavalier, but that for his own particular he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved neither to be deceived nor to deceive others, and that he ſaw no ſuch thing. He adds, like a man of Senſe, that without having Recourſe to this Marvel which was not eaſie to prove, there was another Paſſage not leſs remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable or ſurpriſing, and which ought to be wholly attributed to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and that is, that in this Attempt there was not one Perſon of Quality loſt except <hi>Milon</hi> or <hi>Miles</hi> the Lord of <hi>Nogent</hi> who was drowned. A ſtrange and marvellous Adventure! which we have ſeen repeated within a few days, by that admirable Reflux, and if I may venture to expreſs it ſo, Circulation of the ſame Events which produces the ſame thing in ſucceeding Ages which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in thoſe paſt ſo long ago. For in the War with <hi>Holland,</hi> where the King of <hi>France</hi> by the prodigious Succeſs of his Arms made himſelf Maſter in leſs than one <hi>Champagne</hi> of above thirty ſtrong places; he commanded a Party of his Cavalry to paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> not far from its Mouth, under the Conduct of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Count de Guiche,</hi> where thoſe Braves, in the View of their Enemies who were drawn up on the other ſide to oppoſe them, paſſed that great River, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Ford till that time unknown, and partly by ſwimming, without any other conſiderable Loſs than that of the <hi>Count de Nogent,</hi> who there periſhed in ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing by a glorious Death, his Zeal and Courage in one of the faireſt Occaſions that were ever ſeen. But it is in ſhort, that one ought to expect, that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was great or Heroick in their Anceſtors, is in our time to be performed by their Deſcendants, under a King, who hitherto hath carried the Glory of this Auguſt Monarchy to a higher Degree, than any of his Illuſtrious Predeceſſors have done ſince <hi>Charlemain.</hi>

Whileſt in the mean time the King was in great Straits for Subſiſtence, and finding himſelf in no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Attaque them in ſo ſtrong a Place, drew towards <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a large Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not ſo well Fortified as to be in a Condition to Reſiſt him, and there he hoped to meet with ſome Refreſhment for his Army. He arrived there three or four days after the Battle, but to his great Diſappointment he found, by the Baſeneſs of him that Commanded there for the Emperor, that there was no manner of Proviſion for the Army. It was this wicked Villain, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Convoy a party of the poor <hi>Germans</hi> who had ſaved themſelves after their Defeat, lead them into an Ambuſcade of <hi>Turks,</hi> who put them all to the Sword, and with whom, as it was before Agreed, he divided their Spoil. This Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Traitor, fearing, it ſeems, that the <hi>French</hi> would be Revenged of him for his Treachery, or elſe that, imagining he ſhould not be able to Betray them in the ſame manner, he was reſolved to do them a greater Miſchief, after having cauſed all the Inhabitants to Retire with their Goods and Proviſions to the Woods and Mountains, went himſelf to ſeek a Refuge among the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that the King was obliged to ſtay there, till thoſe Fugitives could be found and

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> after which loading their Waggons and Sumpters with Proviſions, which the King, who was for rendring Good for Evil, would have them paid for, the Army decamped and took the way of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> that ſo they might by Marching near the Sea have a more commodious Paſſage, and meet with better Plenty of Forrage and Subſiſtence. And tho they knew that both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> Coaſted along with them, tho at a great Diſtance, yet they were eſteemed ſuch contemptible Enemies, and the <hi>French</hi> were ſo Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent after the Victory they had gained, that there was too little care taken to ſtand upon their Guard: But this Preſumption, as it uſually happens, did not fail to be very Pernicious to this Army, which was unfortunately beaten by the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the Fault of one Man, who neglected to obſerve the Orders which were wiſely Eſtabliſhed by Military Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>the Army following the Cuſtom of thoſe Times, was divided only into two Bodies, one of which compoſed the Vanguard, and the other the Rereguard. To avoid Jealouſies, theſe two Bodies were every day Commanded by two of the Principal Lords, who under the King took their ſeveral Turns, the King ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Marching with one, ſometimes with the other: Every Night they Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Councel, at which all the Lords Aſſiſted, where Orders were iſſued out concerning the Way of the next days March, and the Place where the Army was to Encamp. Now there happened to be in the Way which they muſt of neceſſity paſs, a mighty high Mountain, extream difficult of Acceſs by reaſon of the dangerous Narrowneſs and broken Craggs and Rocks where the Army muſt file off. The King therefore following the Reſolution which had been taken at the Councel, gave Order, that they ſhould Encamp on the Top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that they ſhould paſs the Night there, and the next Morning deſcend into the Plain in order of Battle. He who led the Vanguard that Day, was <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offry Rancon</hi> of <hi>Poitiers</hi> Lord of <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> who carried the Royal Standard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom, next the Oriſlame at the Head of this Vanguard; The Count <hi>de Morienne,</hi> the King's Uncle, with the Queen and all the Ladies of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were there alſo by very good Fortune, going before, that ſo they might come in better time to the Place where they were to Incamp. The King, who uſually choſe the Place where there was moſt Danger, had put himſelf into the Rere, that ſo he might make Head againſt the Enemies, if they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to Follow or Moleſt him as they had done at the Battle of <hi>Meander. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offry</hi> Arrived at the Mountain in very good time, and ſeeing the Sun yet of a great height, and his Guides telling him that if he did but make a little the more Haſt, he might Incamp far more Commodiouſly, in one of the faireſt Plains of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he ſhould meet with all ſorts of Refreſhments for the Army; forgetting therefore the Orders of the King, with extream Raſhneſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Mountain, and Marched a great way to that agreeable Place which had been ſhewed him, ſuppoſing that the Arrierguard not finding him upon the Mountain, would certainly follow him. But he took very falſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and in deceiving himſelf in this manner, occaſioned the Loſs of the other part of the Army, which was more miſerably deceived by him. For the very ſame Reaſon which made him March forward from the Mountain to gain the Valley, made the others alſo, ſeeing the Sun ſo high, to make no haſt to get to the Mountain, where they doubted not but to find him Encamped according to the King's Orders. By this means the <hi>Turks,</hi> who Coaſted all along conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Army, perceiving that the two Bodies were ſo ſeparated, that it was impoſſible for the one to Aſſiſt the other, ran immediately to Seiſe upon the Top of the Mountain, where they preſently cut in pieces all thoſe of the ſcattering Infantry, whom they found there for the moſt part Unarmed, being not able to follow the Groſs of the Army, and having ſeiſed the Paſs, they cut off the Rereguard in ſuch manner that it was impoſſible for them to joyn with the Van, without paſſing through the whole Army of their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>It was a ſtrange Surpriſe to theſe Troops, who after they were Advanced a good way up the Mountain into the ſtrait Paſſages, believing there to find their Companions, inſtead of them to meet with their Enemies, who at an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſcharged upon them a fearful Cloud of Arrows, and who ſhooting from on high upon a company who were Intangled and Diſordered one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64918:69"/>tumbled them down with mighty Blows of the Mace and Cimiter,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> before they almoſt thought of betaking themſelves to their Arms. The firſt being Overthrown tumbled upon thoſe in the Middle, where were the Chariots Loaden with Arms, and the Beaſts of Burthen with the Baggage, ſo that the moſt valiant Men of the Army which followed them, were not able to get over that Stop, to Charge the Enemy, who made a horrible Butchery among thoſe who could neither Retreat nor Advance: The Men, the Mules, the Horſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crowded, in Shoals came tumbling down upon thoſe who indeavoured to gain a Paſſage to come to the Enemies, who Fought with all manner of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſince in this fearful Confuſion there was none in a Condition to Oppoſe them. In the End, the Lords followed by their beſt Soldiers, and the King himſelf at their Head, made ſo good Way, that whileſt the others Fled in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, indeavouring to eſcape round the Mountain, they got up to the place where the <hi>Turks</hi> had Poſted themſelves in Battalia, to ſupport thoſe of their Troops who had made the firſt Charge. There it was that there was a kind of regular Combat; the <hi>French</hi> Animating one another by the Preſence of the King, and by the little Account that was to be made of ſuch as they had Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed at the <hi>Meander,</hi> and principally by the fatal Neceſſity to which they were reduced, either to Conquer or to Dye. The <hi>Turks</hi> on the other hand were Incouraged by the great Advantage which they had already gained, by the Diſorder in which they ſaw their Enemies, by the ſmall Number of thoſe that Charged them, and eſpecially by the Remembrance of the Fortune of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Army, which they had ſo luckily Defeated in the Straits of ſuch ſort of Mountains. The Fight was maintained with extreme Fury, for the <hi>French,</hi> to whom ſtill thoſe who could Advance joyned themſelves, ſlew in like Lions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thickeſt of their Enemies, where they made a moſt horrible Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had there their whole Army, ſending in continual Troops of freſh Men to Inforce their Men, and the <hi>French,</hi> who were but a ſmall Handful, ſurrounded with a vaſt Multitude, could do no more than it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Men to do, ſo that it was impoſſible, but being drained of all their Blood and Strength, and not having time to take any Breath, but that they muſt ſink under that Misfortune; moſt of thoſe gallant Men being there either Slain or taken Priſoners; the Count <hi>de Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This brave Prince ſtill Fought with an invincible Courage, Invironed with ſo many Enemies, and the Bodies of ſo many of his generous Friends who lay dead at his Feet, till ſuch time as ſome one of his Cavaliers, laying hold of his Horſes Bridle, made way with their Swords quite through the Body of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſo gained the Top of the Mountain, where they Incloſed him with a Wall of their own Bodies, to defend him, till the Obſcurity of the Night, which now drew on apace, favoured him with a Retreat. But the greateſt part of them being Slain by a great Troop of <hi>Turks</hi> who Purſued them, without knowing that it was the King, he found himſelf almoſt alone, and therefore quitting his Horſe, he ſcrambled up a Rock by the help of ſome Bows of a Tree which grew there, thinking that might be a convenient Place to enable him to defend himſelf from the Purſuers. But the <hi>Turks</hi> Compaſſing him round, ſome ſhot at him to bring him down, others indeavoured to Climb up after him, to Kill or take him Priſoner. In all appearance it was impoſſible that he could Eſcape, but nevertheleſs by a particular Protection of God, and by a Prodigy of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Valour, he did eſcape this Danger. His Curiaſs guarded him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently againſt the Arrows, and with his Sword cutting off the Hands, and ſplitting the Sculls of thoſe who indeavoured to get up to him upon the Rock, he Defended himſelf with ſuch an incredible Force, and without Wearineſs, that the <hi>Turks</hi> who took him for ſome ordinary Cavalier, ſurpriſed by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Valour, and fearing beſides that here they ſhould get nothing but Blows, and looſe alſo their Share in the Plunder, they left him to run to the Booty, before it was quite Night, with the reſt of their Companions.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time ſome Soldiers and Servants of the Army, who under the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64918:69"/>Favour of the Darkneſs were indeavouring to Eſcape,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> among the Rocks paſſed by the Place where the King was, and knowing him by his Voice, for he called to them, perceiving them to be of his own People; and thereupon mounting upon a led-Horſe, after having wandred a good part of the Night in unknown and dangerous Places, at the laſt they diſcovered the Fires of the Vanguard, and a little after met with the Troops of Horſe which were coming to meet them. For the King during the Combat, had commanded his Chaplain <hi>Eudes,</hi> the Monk of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> to ſave himſelf as well as he could, and make haſt to the Camp of the Vanguard, to order them to March inſtantly to his Relief; but the Way being long and difficult, and that they had not Notice till very late, this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour came too late, and ſerved to no other purpoſe but to Conduct the King to the Camp, after having found him in this pittiful Eſtate. It is impoſſible to expreſs the Conſternation which the Army was in, ſeeing the King ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Accompanied, after the Loſs of ſo many Lords of the firſt Quality, and almoſt all the Rereguard, except a few Soldiers who ſaved themſelves in the Woods and Mountains, and at laſt found the Way to the Camp, whither they came ſtraggling one after another all the Night. There was ſcarcely any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Camp but what had ſome Share in this deplorable Loſs: One lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Father, another his Son, this his Brother, that his Kinſman or his Friend; ſome ran to Embrace thoſe of their Acquaintance, who were got off half Naked, and without their Arms; whileſt others who conceived a like Hope for theirs, in vain expected thoſe who were never to Return. However all of them Comforted themſelves in this extream Grief, by the Joy which they had at the Kings Eſcape, after he had run ſuch a fearful Danger of being Loſt, and had defended himſelf from it in that Heroick manner which hath been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and in ſhort, all of them in the midſt of this Grief and Joy, tumultuouſly and loudly demanded the Death of <hi>Geoffry,</hi> who had moſt apparently been the only Cauſe of this horrible Loſs, by diſobeying thoſe Orders which had been preſcribed him by the King, and ſo furiouſly were they Incenſed againſt him, that nothing would ſatisfy them but to have him Hanged immediately: And certainly it is impoſſible to deny but that he well deſerved to have ſuffered Death, but ſuch was the Bounty and natural Goodneſs of the King, and the Count <hi>de Morienne,</hi> having alſo in a great Meaſure been Guilty of that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, for whom the King had a great Value, he ſcaped with his Life.</p>
                  <p>The next Day when they were to Decamp, the Army was reduced to very great Extremities. For they diſcovered the Enemies upon the Tops of the Mountains, ready to follow the remainder of the Army, and to take all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to Surpriſe them again upon their March. The Proviſions began to fail; they had twelve days March to the Place whither they deſigned to go, they wanted good Guides, and muſt of neceſſity paſs through Countries poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> who were equally their Enemies. All theſe Dangers and Difficulties, how great ſoever, did not yet abate the Courage of the <hi>French,</hi> who are uſually Reproached with looſing a great part of their Fire and their natural Confidence, when they are under adverſe Fortune; however it did not happen ſo upon this Occaſion, which only made them more Wiſe, and not leſs Valiant or Reſolved. The King to model this new Army, divided it alſo into two Bodies, one of which was the Rereguard; He gave the Command of this to the Great Maſter of the Temple, <hi>Everard de Barres,</hi> a moſt valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſome days before was come to joyn the Army with a good Troop of the Knights of that Order. The Conduct of the other he intruſted with an old Captain, one <hi>Gilbert,</hi> to whom all the others, though in Quality much Superior to him, yet, made no Difficulty to ſubmit themſelves, ſince the King himſelf proteſted that he would obey his Orders. But he moſt humbly intreated the King, to put himſelf between theſe two Bodies with a good Body of Horſe and Foot, that ſo he might be able from thence to ſend Aſſiſtance to either of them, if they ſhould happen to be much Preſſed by the Enemy. The Baggage marched in the Middle, and a great part of the Horſe were Ranged upon the Wings to the Right and Left, to cover the Flanks of the Army. In this manner it was that they Advanced, and in this Order marched daily towards <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> with ſo much Conduct, that the Enemies who Coaſted along with them, and Attacked
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64918:70"/>them four ſeveral times,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> were continually Repulſed; and particularly one time the King ſeeing them Ingaged between two little Rivers, Charged them ſo ſmartly, that he took a ſufficient Revenge upon them for the Defeat of his Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, cutting in pieces the greateſt part of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and putting the reſt to a ſhameful Flight.</p>
                  <p>The moſt troubleſom Enemy which he had to Combat was Want, for all the Country was either Deſert, or ruined by the Enemies, who laid all waſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Army was to paſs; ſo that they were reduced to that Extremity to Eat their Horſes, which they were alſo conſtrained to kill for want of Forrage for ſo great a Number. But that which ſupported them ſtill, was the Example of the King, who indured all theſe Inconveniences as if he had been one of the meaneſt Soldiers: Some he commended, others he incouraged, and liberally beſtowed what he had among them to Comfort the poor Creatures; his Care was every where, and he took his Share in all the Troubles of the War, having his Curiaſs on almoſt Night and Day, and performing all the Functions of a Great Captain and a Soldier with all the Vigor imaginable; And to all this he added a Piety towards God ſo conſtant and regular, that in all the time of this laborious Voyage he never failed to attend the Divine Offices of publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In Concluſion, the Enemies after their laſt Defeat not daring to appear or to moleſt the Army, they performed this long March with the greater Eaſe, and about the twentieth of <hi>January</hi> Arrived near the City of <hi>Attalia,</hi> Situate upon a Bay on the Coaſt of <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> near the Mouth of the River <hi>Ceſtrius.</hi> The Governor of that City, which was under the Dominion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, fearing that he was not able to Reſiſt ſo great an Army, if he declared himſelf their Enemy, offered the King Proviſions and Ships to Tranſport his Army into <hi>Syria,</hi> which was the Thing he moſt ardently Deſired, thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in no Condition to accompliſh ſo long a March by Land; for the King, who had no Engines for a Siege, and was willing to ſatisfy his Army by ſhortning the Voyage, was very ready to accept of his Offer: But there was no manner of Miſchief which this Perfidious and true <hi>Greek,</hi> who held Intelligence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> did not do, to Incommode and Ruine, as far as he was able, this whole Army, during five Weeks which they lay there in Expectation of a Wind. And then he would find ſuch a ſmall number of Ships, and thoſe at ſuch exceſſive Rates, that the King was at laſt conſtrained to Imbarque himſelf, without his Infantry. He then treated with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who obliged themſelves for a large ſum of Mony, which was paid in Hand, to receive the Sick into the Town, till they ſhould be able to indure the Sea, and to Convoy the reſt who choſe to go by Land, through the midſt of the <hi>Turks,</hi> than to truſt to theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Greeks,</hi> who notwithſtanding failed not to Sell and Betray them.</p>
                  <p>For ſo ſoon as the King was gone, the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who received Advertiſement from theſe Traitors, came pouring down from all Parts, upon theſe who were to venture by Land; and for thoſe who were received into the Town, the <hi>Greeks</hi> either Starved them, or inhumanly Delivered them into the Hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> inſomuch, that of all thoſe brave Men, there was but a very few who Eſcaped by Land with the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Archambald de Bourbon,</hi> who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly offered themſelves to be their Conductors. And now it was, that it appeared too late, to be a vain Scruple, which was to ſo ill Purpoſe oppoſed againſt the wiſe Council of the Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> who adviſed the Seiſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and which occaſioned the Loſs of ſuch a fair Army, as, if it had begun with that Enterpriſe ſo juſt, ſo eaſy, and ſo neceſſary, might glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly have Triumphed over the whole <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and abſolutely aſſured the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But it is the common Weakneſs of the greateſt part of Mankind, not to know what they ought to do, till for want of doing it, all is ſo far loſt, that when they would, they want the Power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the Will. But as for this perſidious City, it was afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Puniſhed both by God and the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, though for very different Reaſons. For God to revenge the Inhumane Treachery with which they had treated the <hi>French,</hi> ſent ſuch a Peſtilence amongſt the Inhabitants a ſhort time after, as ſwept away the greateſt part of them; and the Emperor out of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they had aſſiſted the <hi>French</hi> with Proviſions and Shipping, laid ſuch a

                  <p>In the mean time the King, who had taken the Sea, with all the great Lords, and the remainder of the Cavalry, which might yet compoſe a conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, came happily to an Anchor at the Port of St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> upon the Mouth of the <hi>Orontes,</hi> about four or five Leagues from <hi>Antioch;</hi> into which place he made his Entry, upon the 19th Day of <hi>March,</hi> and was received with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Magnificence by Prince <hi>Raymond,</hi> who was Uncle, by the Mother, to Queen <hi>Eleoner.</hi> Now this Prince paſſionately deſiring that the King ſhould immediately enter upon a War in <hi>Syria,</hi> to conquer for him <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and the other places belonging to the Principality of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which were yet poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> there was no ſort of Artifice which he did not put in practice, to oblige him to undertake it. He had Recourſe to all manner of Submiſſions and Prayers; he made uſe of the Solicitations of the Queen, his Niece; he made magnificent Preſents to all the <hi>French</hi> Lords; and in ſhort, he omitted no kind of Reaſons, but preſſed them with his utmoſt force, both privately, and in Council, to perſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So that, as it commonly happens, that one violent Paſſion eaſily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to another Extream; this Prince being inſinitely exaſperated by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, and it may be, not a little animated by another Paſſion in his Niece, to which he joyned his, he entertained ſuch a mortal Hatred againſt the King, that there was nothing which he did not reſolve to do, to revenge himſelf. For this reaſon, the King, who knew he was to apprehend all things from a Spirit ſo furiouſly tranſported, that he valued not what he did, ſecretly conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Night out of the City, in a manner not very well becoming the Majeſty of ſo great a Monarch; and taking the Queen along with him, not much to her Satisfaction, he went and joyned his Troops, which were encamped under the Walls, and marched directly towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> was already arrived, from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he had paſſed the Winter.</p>
                  <p>For that Prince, who was reſolved to accompliſh his Vow; and who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſmall Remainder of his Troops which were left after his Misfortune, gave no Jealouſie to <hi>Manuel,</hi> eaſily obtained from him Shipping, to tranſport himſelf and his Troops, in the Spring, by Sea; as he did, to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> or <hi>Acon:</hi> from whence he paſſed by Land to <hi>Jeruſalem. Alphonſus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> and Son to the brave <hi>Raymond,</hi> who had ſo great a Part in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> coming at the ſame time, to the ſame Port, took another Way, all along by the Sea-Coaſt; but he was ſtopped in his Journey, by a deplorable Death, as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Ceſarea;</hi> being unfortunately poyſoned one Evening, at his Supper, without ever being known, either for what Reaſon, or by what Perſon, that execrable Fact was committed.</p>
                  <p>It was no ſooner known at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the King, who, it was feared, would have ſtayed at <hi>Antioch,</hi> according to the earneſt Deſires and Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Raymond,</hi> was parted from thence, and that he took the Way of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> but that King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who feared leſt the Earl of <hi>Tripolis</hi> ſhould alſo preſs him ſtrongly to ſtay there, ſent immediately to him, <hi>Fulcherius</hi> the Patriarch, to propound to him ſuch Reaſons as, he believed, would oblige him to make what haſte he could to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Emperor had now been for ſome time; that ſo there they might take ſome good and ſolid Reſolution, for the common and publick Advantage of Affairs: To this the King, who deſired nothing more, eaſily accorded; and therefore kept on his way, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any where, till he arrived at the Holy City.

                  <p>There never was a more illuſtrious Aſſembly ſeen in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> than this; which was honoured with the Preſence of ſo many great Princes.

                  <p>It was a long time under Debate, what was moſt advantageous to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the common Intereſt; and in concluſion, they determined to beſiege <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> Which being, as it were, in the Centre and Midſt of the four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities which the Chriſtians held in the Eaſt, might be equally dangerous to them all. Upon this, all the Troops were appointed to rendezvous, the five and twentieth Day of <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Tiberias;</hi> where a general Review being made of the Army, they advanced to <hi>Paneas,</hi> near the Head of <hi>Jordan;</hi> the Patriarch carrying the true Croſs, or, at leaſt, that which was believed to be ſo, before them. The Meaſures which were taken for the Siege, were according to the Opinion of the Lords of that Country, who were beſt acquainted with the Strength and Weakneſs of the place. After which, croſſing the celebrated Mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> they deſcended into the fair Champain of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Daria,</hi> a little Village, about two Leagues from <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> from the moſt elevated place whereof, the Towers of that ſtately City were eaſily to be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> one of the moſt ancient, and ſometimes one of the faireſt and greateſt Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> is ſituate in a large Plain, at the Foot of Mount <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon;</hi> which is watered with two Rivers, and a great number of little Springs and Fountains; which, notwithſtanding its natural Inclination to Sterility, it being a hungry, ſandy Soil, render it very fruitful and delightful. Theſe two Rivers take their Riſe upon the Eaſt, at no very great diſtance, from the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Amana,</hi> which is a part of Mount <hi>Lebanon:</hi> the leſſer is called <hi>Abana,</hi> and ſlows all along by the Walls of the City, upon the Weſt; the greater, which is <hi>Pharpar,</hi> and which ſome have confounded with the <hi>Orontes;</hi> and, for the beauty of its Streams, is called <hi>Chryorrhoas,</hi> or <hi>Golden Stream;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having paſſed through the City, and wandred through the Fields and the Valleys of the neighbouring Country, loſeth it ſelf under the Earth; either becauſe, being divided into a multitude of Canals, which are drawn, to render the Earth more fruitful, that it is ſo diminiſhed, that at laſt it ends in them; or that by ſome unknown, Subterranean Paſſages, it diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Phenician</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64918:71"/>
                  <p>It was the great Conveniency of making theſe Canals,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> which made all that part of the City towards the North, and a great part of the Weſt, be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a prodigious number of Gardens and Orchards, where were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an infinite of Trees, producing all manner of Fruits, the moſt delicious of all the Eaſt. Theſe Gardens were divided, one from the other, by little narrow Paſſages, which cutting one another, and turning and winding ſeveral ways, without any regular Art or Figure, formed a kind of undeſigned Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, where it was eaſie for thoſe who were unacquainted with them, to loſe themſelves in thoſe delightful places. Every Garden had its Houſe, and its little Tower, according to the Mode of the <hi>Orientals,</hi> for the Convenience, and the Lodging of its Maſter: So that the City being very populous, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gardens which covered thoſe ſides, was very great, and extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt two Leagues; ſo that, viewing it upon that ſide, it repreſented to the Sight a large Foreſt, which ſeemed to extend it ſelf to the very Walls. But on the contrary, the other ſide, which lay to the Eaſt and South, had not ſo much as a Tree, a Hedge, or a Buſh; but ſhewed a bald Champaign, from whence it was eaſie to diſcern the whole City; which was defended with high Walls, which were fortified with great Towers, whereof four, which liſted up their proud Heads above the reſt, were of an extraordinary heighth and ſtrength: and above all, it was defended by a Fortreſs, which was eſteemed the faireſt, and moſt regular of all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City had been taken from the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe Sultan, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequin,</hi> made a moſt cruel War againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> between the time of the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Cruſade.</hi> After his death, his Succeſſors, ſeeing themſelves attacked by <hi>Sanguin,</hi> the redoubted Sultan of <hi>Alepo</hi> and <hi>Ninevch,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Conqueſt of all <hi>Syria,</hi> joyned themſelves with the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, to make War againſt this common Enemy. They aſſiſted them, according to the Treaty in the Taking of <hi>Paneas,</hi> which they had taken from the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> before, and <hi>Sanguin</hi> from them again. But there being little Faith to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Infidels, they ſoon brake the Peace, and declared themſelves, as before, the mortal Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For this reaſon it was, that the Reſolution was ſixed to attack them, and above all things, to carry this City, which was in a Condition to give the Check-mate to the four <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities of the Eaſt. Hereupon it was alſo reſolved in the Council, to attack the Town on the Garden-ſides, that ſo the Army might have the Convenience of the River, the Fruits and Forrage, which were there to be had in abundance. The next Morning therefore, the Army, being divided into three Bodies, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in good Order towards <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> drawing from the Weſt, towards the North, to the Garden-Quarter of the City. The young King of <hi>Jeruſalem, Baldwin</hi> the Third, commanded in Perſon the firſt Body, compoſed of his own Troops, and thoſe of the Princes of <hi>Syria,</hi> who had the ſame Intereſt with him in the Siege. The <hi>French</hi> made the ſecond, having at their Head King <hi>Lewis</hi> to ſupport the firſt, which they followed at a little diſtance, to be always ready to afford them Succour. The Emperor, with his <hi>Germans,</hi> had the Rere, to oppoſe the Enemy's Cavalry, if they ſhould attempt to fall upon them as they made their Approaches. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who thirſted mightily after Glory, and was tranſported with Joy, to meet with ſo fair an Opportunity to diſplay his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in the View of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> did inſtantly preſs to make the firſt Attack; which was eaſily granted him, in regard he alledged, that his People were better acquainted than the reſt, with the nature of the place, and the Turnings of the Gardens. He was a Prince, who was now advanced to the Flower of his Youth, being between eight and nine and twenty Years of Age: he was of Stature ſomething leſs than the Middle, but of a Proportion ſo juſt and regular in all the parts of his Body, that his want of Heighth did not leſſen that Port and Majeſty of a King which he wore, and which made him be known for one, by ſuch as had the honour to ſee him; the Shape of his Face, and the Turn of all his Lincaments were very handſom; his Eyes indifferent large and full, extream ſweet and ſparkling, with a Fire that wanted nothing in it of Attractive; his Hair was inclining to Fair, of a lively Colour, well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Beholders of the ſtrength of his Robuſt Conſtitution; his Cheeks
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64918:72"/>plump,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> and tinctured with Vermilion; and in ſhort, having in his Compoſure, all that was delicate and lovely in Queen <hi>Meleſintha,</hi> his Mother, and the Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Second, his Grandfather, whom he much reſembled: And, to make the Harmony compleat, he had a Soul proportionable to his Body; for his Mind was quick, eaſie, ready and penetrating, which had been cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Study of all manner of gentile and ingenuous Learning, and which was of wonderful Advantage to him; he had a moſt happy Memory, and a marvellous Facility in expreſſing himſelf eloquently upon the ſuddain, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any kind of Subject of Diſcourſe; he was naturally of one of the beſt Tempers in the World, of a heart truly Royal; being liberal, magniſicent, affable, obliging, complaiſant, of a good Humour, and one who underſtood innocent and divertive Rallery, and how to uſe it without loſing his Friend, rather than his Wit; for he was rather naturally ſober, vigilant and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, brave and undaunted in War, expoſing himſelf freely to Dangers, and ſuffering equally with the meaneſt Soldier: And, to conclude, all his greateſt Accompliſhment was, that he was, above all, a moſt devout and religious Prince; having, among all theſe Perfections that could be wiſhed in a great King, as few Failings as moſt common Men, being a little inclined by his Heat, to love Play, and the Converſation of the Ladies; but if he erred in any thing in this laſt Particular, he corrected it afterward, by a lawful Marriage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baldwin</hi> being ſuch as I have endeavoured to deſcribe him, full of Courage, and Martial Fire; ambitious of Glory, in valiantly fighting in view of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and a King of <hi>France,</hi> who were followed by the braveſt Men of the Weſt, marched briskly to attack theſe Gardens, which, like a Labyrinth, ſeemed to render the Town inacceſſible on that Quarter: but he found that the Enterpriſe was not ſo eaſie as he had painted it in his conquering Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the Honour which he pretended to gain, was like to prove a very dear Purchace. For the <hi>Turks,</hi> who well knew that their Safety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the Preſervation of this Poſt, had placed the greateſt part of their Garriſon there to defend it: Some of them were retrenched and barricadoed in the Narrow Ways, where not above two could paſs a-breaſt; where they repulſed thoſe who aſſiſted them, with Puſh of Pike: Others, having broken ſmall Holes in the Walls which parted the Gardens, pierced with their Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, from both ſides, ſuch Soldiers as were in the Paſſages, who could not come to be revenged of thoſe Enemies, who wounded them without appearing: A great number of others were mounted upon the Turrets, and the Tops of the Houſes; from whence they poured an inſinite number of mortal Arrows from above, upon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who were below, whilſt others threw down huge Stones upon thoſe who were wedged in thoſe narrow Paſſages, and could no ways ſecure themſelves from that fearful Hail. So that the Soldiers being neither able to advance, nor retreat, by reaſon of the multitude of thoſe who preſſed forward in following them, and that they were ſtopped by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, periſhed miſerably, without being able to come at the Enemy, who attacked them under their Covertures, without partaking at all in the danger of the Combat.</p>
                  <p>The young King, fretting with Anger and Madneſs, to ſee his firſt Attempt ſucceed ſo ill, reſolved to repair the Loſs, or to periſh; and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to change the Order of the Attack, and to turn the Fight from Filing two and two a breaſt in thoſe narrow Ways, to the attempting to make Breaches into theſe Incloſures, through the Walls. Now theſe Walls being but low, and made of Earth, the ardent deſire of the Soldiers to be revenged, re-doubled their Strength: ſo that they fell to pulling down the Walls with their Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and other Inſtruments which were brought for that Service; and in a little time they had made a great many Breaches, by which they furiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into theſe Gardens. The <hi>Turks</hi> who had, for their own Security, and to keep out the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſhut themſelves cloſe up in theſe Gardens, being cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, had ſo cut off their own Retreat, that in a little time there was made a mighty Slaughter among them: Whereupon, the others, who were yet in the other Gardens that were not taken, having taken the Fright, as well as thoſe who guarded the Barricades, abandoned them, and ſaved themſelves within the Town.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64918:72"/>
                  <p>The Ways being thus cleared,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> all the Van-Guard paſſed without any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and advanced almoſt to the City, where they were neceſſitated to a new Combat, far more furious than the firſt: For all the Cavalry of the Enemies, ſupported by the beſt part of their Infantry, ſuſpecting that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> after they had carried the Gardens, would run in diſorder to the River, had placed themſelves in Battalia upon the Banks of it, to prohibit their Approaches. The young King, who was reſolved to have all the Honour of this Day, making uſe of the Heat of his Soldiers, who, all covered with Sweat and Duſt, and burnt with Heat and Thirſt, longed for the Water of the River; having inſtantly rallied them, he charged fiercely into the thickeſt Squadrons of the Enemies: But they being all freſh, whereas his People were faint, and quite tired out, do what he could, after he had made two furious Charges, he was repulſed, and his Troops put into ſome Diſorder. There was a neceſſity that he muſt ſtop a little, to rally his Men, and to attend the coming up of the Main Body, which followed ſlowly; and was alſo obliged to make a little Halt, after it had joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, for Convenience of drawing up into Order. It was upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> performed an Action, which, though certainly ſomething too raſh, and a little irregular, yet ought to have given him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conſolation for all his former ill Fortune in this ſecond <hi>Cruſade:</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demanded why theſe two Bodies which marched before his, halted ſo long, ſince he underſtood that the Van-Guard was engaged with the Enemy, who had gained ſome Advantage upon them, he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo tranſported with the deſire of the Combat, that running at full Speed, followed by all his <hi>Germans,</hi> quite through the Body of the Battel, without any Order, he flew, with his Sword in his hand, into the midſt of the Enemies; who, unable to reſiſt the Shock of ſuch a furious and unexpected Charge, inſtantly gave Ground. It is ſaid alſo, that he gave ſuch another dreadful Blow as that of the great <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> which finiſhed the Victory, already inclining upon his firſt Charge; for a puiſſant <hi>Turk,</hi> armed with a Curiaſs, having attacked him, he diſcharged with all his force ſuch a furious Blow upon the place where the Shoulder joyns to the Neck, that the Sword paſſing through the Neck, to the right Shoulder, took that and part of the Breaſt clear off; the Head, and that Arm and Shoulder falling to the Ground, whilſt the other remained a Spectacle of Horrour, for ſome time, upon the Horſe. The <hi>Turks,</hi> amazed at this frightful Blow, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fled, and ſaved themſelves in the Town, leaving all the Fields and the Rivers free to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who immediately encamped upon the Banks, and in the Gardens, with mighty convenience, both for the Men and Horſes. This Victory brought ſuch a Deſpair among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that knowing well that they were in danger of loſing the place upon the firſt Aſſault which ſhould be given, there being on that ſide no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence beſide the Gardens, which were now loſt, they began to think of nothing but how to ſave themſelves by retreating. For this purpoſe they barricadoed all the Streets which opened that way, to the end, that while their Enemies were buſie in breaking the Barricadoes, and removing the great Beams which they had laid croſs the Streets, they might have the more time to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Families by the oppoſite Gates, and ſo retreat with more Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſuch neighbouring Towns as were in the Hands of their Friends. Thus had <hi>Damaſcus</hi> moſt aſſuredly fallen into the Power of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Hatred and Envy; three furious Paſſions, which at this time wrought more deplorable Effects than the Arms of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> had not ſuddainly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated their Affairs, by a moſt infamous Treaſon, from a certain Hope, and a flouriſhing Condition, into the very Gulph of Misfortune and Confuſion, from whence they were never able to recover again.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſeeing themſelves thus juſt upon the Eve of their Ruin, after they had barricadoed the Streets, they adviſed themſelves again of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means to ſave themſelves, which did not fail of the wiſhed Effect. After that the <hi>French</hi> had conquered the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> many Perſons of both Sexes, not only of the Common People, but alſo of the Nobility, were married in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> with the Ladies of that Country; and many of the great Lords who were in <hi>Baldwin</hi>'s Army, were ſuch as were born of thoſe Marriages, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64918:73"/>conſequently <hi>Syrians</hi> by Birth,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> and by Original, either by Father or Mother. And as theſe kind of Mungrels uſually degenerate from the fair Qualities of the more noble Nations, and participate of the Imperfections of the other, ſo many of theſe half <hi>French,</hi> half <hi>Syrian</hi> Lords retained the Vices of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and particularly, Greedineſs of Riches, and Avarice, which to this day is the domineering Vice and Paſſion of the <hi>Orientals.</hi> The <hi>Turks,</hi> and principal Men of the City, who being of the ſame Country, very well knew their <hi>Feeble,</hi> ſecretly ſent ſome of the moſt dexterous and cunning of their Citizens, to theſe Motley Lords and Barons, whom they knew to be of the moſt covetous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and conſequently moſt capable of being brought into Treaſon: To theſe they gave all imaginable Aſſurances that they could deſire, that they ſhould have certain Payment made of moſt conſiderable Sums of Money, provided they could induce the Beſiegers only to change their Attack, and remove the Siege to the other ſide of the City. Now he to whom they principally truſted the Management of this Affair, found amongſt thoſe to whom he addreſſed himſelf, Inclinations favourable as he could deſire, to entertain his Propoſitions. Prince <hi>Raymond,</hi> who mortally hated King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Seventh, after the Affair of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> had, as it is ſaid, beforehand corrupted ſome of his People, and obliged them underhand, to do all that poſſibly they could againſt him, that ſo he might not acquire any Glory from this War. There were others who could not, with Patience, think of permitting the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as they underſtood it was concluded between the Emperor and the two Kings, to enjoy the Principality of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and they had rather that it ſhould continue in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> than fall to the ſhare of a Man, whom they looked upon as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in regard he was not born in <hi>Syria.</hi> Thus the Envy of ſome, and the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which <hi>Raymond</hi> had inſpired into others, being joyned with the Avarice which reigned equally in both the one and the other, produced the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and moſt cowardly Treaſon, that it was poſſible for Lords of great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not to ſay <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be capable of: For, counterfeiting a marvellous Zeal for the publick Good, they remonſtrated to the Council, <hi>That hitherto they had taken very falſe Meaſures; That they had too long permitted themſelves to be deceived with vain Appearances of a commodious Encampment upon the Banks of the River, among the Gardens and Orchards; not conſidering that this was the main Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, which had hitherto hindred the Taking of the City; for that the River, one part whereof ſerved for the Ditch upon that Quarter, rendred the Acceſs more difficult, and the Attack moſt dangerous; That the Gardens hindred the diſpoſing of the Machins to ſuch convenient Diſtances as were requiſite for the Battery; and that the Siege being ſpun out to a greater length than had been promiſed to the Soldiers, there was great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that being diſguſted, and the great Heats beginning now to become inſupportable, they would quit the Siege. That for this Reaſon they were in the Opinion, that they ought to remove the Camp to the other ſide of the City, between the South and Eaſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that there being no Gardens, nor Rivers, nor Ditches full of Water, which could hinder them from deſcending to the very Foot of the Walls, which were low, weak, and without Terraſſes on that ſide; and where the Beſieged, having not expected to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, had made no Retrenohments, there was all the Appearance imaginable that they ſhould carry the Town at the firſt Aſſault, without ſo much as making uſe of any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of Room for Wonder and Aſtoniſhment, to conſider the Conduct of theſe three great Frinces upon this Occaſion; who at other times wanted neither Spirit, nor Judgment, nor Experience in Martial Affairs, in which it commonly happens, <hi>That no Man fails twice; the firſt Fault that is committed being for the moſt part irreparable.</hi> But whether it was the Eagerneſs of their Deſire to become Maſters of the Town in a little time, which blinded them; or that they believed that it was impoſſible to act more prudently, or more ſafely than by the Counſels of thoſe who who had the greateſt Intereſt in the Taking of the Place; and who being Natives of the Country, muſt needs be much better acquainted than any others, with the Strength or Weakneſs of the City, they fell immediately into the Trap that was ſo artfully prepared for them: For, without enquiring into what might be the Conſequences of ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64918:73"/>precipitate a Reſolution, and without ſo much,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1148</label> which Common Senſe would have adviſed them, as ſending according the Rules of War, any of their own People to enquire into the Nature and Strength of the Place, the Convenience or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencees of making their Attack there, or ſo much as whether there was any Truth in what had been repreſented to them, they gave out preſent Orders to remove the Camp to the other ſide of the Town, to the very place, whither theſe Traytors, to whoſe Conduct they abandoned themſelves, had before reſolved to lead the Army, to the Intent to ſtarve them if they lay any time there, or conſtrain them to raiſe the Siege. And in Truth, they quickly perceived that they were intollerably abuſed and deceived; and that the Walls were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrong and well ſlanked with very good Towers, that there was no poſſibility of aſſaulting the Town on that ſide; that the Army which had made Proviſion but for a few days, pretending to carry the Place ſo quickly by Force, was in no Condition to ſubſiſt in an Encampment, where they wanted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the River, the Gardens and Orchards ſtored with Fruits and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; that Proviſions could not be brought to them in Regard all the Places round about were poſſeſſed by the Enimies; that to return to the Camp which they had quitted ſo lightly, was now a thing impoſſibly, for that the Enemies as ſoon as ever they had left it, had ſeized upon it, and had ſo well fortified all the Avenues, by new Barricadoes and huge Trees which they had piled one upon another, and by great Ditches and good Retrenchments, which they had made, at juſt diſtances one from another, that now it was as eaſie to take the Town as to regain that advantageous Poſt. For this Reaſon the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> ſeeing themſelves ſo ignominiouſly betrayed by thoſe very People, for whoſe aſſiſtance they had undertaken ſo tedious a Voyage, and ran through ſo many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Dangers, inſtantly raiſed the Siege and returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the <hi>Syrians</hi> with their deteſtable Treachery.</p>
                  <p>After this their Spirits being too much exaſperated to hope that there ſhould ever be a firm Union or accord among People, who entertain nothing but Jealouſies and Diſtruſts againſt each other, the Siege of <hi>Aſcalon</hi> which was propoſed in a General Aſſembly, was in little Probability of ſucceeding; for though it was ſtrongly urged, that ſomething of Importance ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and that ſo brave an Army ought not to go away with the Infamy of having to no purpoſe conſumed the Seaſon of the Year for Action, or return without performing any thing memorable; yet the Great Lords, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> ſtiffly and reſolutely oppoſed it, proteſting openly, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſt ſuch a ſort of People, who had neither Conſcience nor Honour; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith which they owed to God and Man, would for a little Money baſely ſell their Chriſtian Brethren, whom with earneſt Sollicitations they had to their great Coſt and Danger brought ſo far to their Aſſiſtance, and betray them into the Hands of the <hi>Infidels</hi> againſt whom they pretended to ſight. The Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> therefore taking his Leave of the Young King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who was altogether Innocent and who abominated the Treaſon of the Confederates, re-imbarked upon the Ships of his Brother-in-Law <hi>Manuel,</hi> and ſailed into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> and from thence by the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> he landed upon the Territories of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſo returned into <hi>Germany,</hi> where about three Years after he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving the Empire to <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia</hi> his Nephew, who had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly taken a part with him in the ill Fortune and the Fatigues of this ſecond <hi>Cruſade.</hi>

But being a man, he was ſo touched to the quick with theſe cutting Reproaches that he was not able to diſſemble the Affliction which they gave him; and though he was a Saint, and an able man, yet not able to bear this Croſs himſelf, he made uſe of all the Strength of his Reaſon and his parts to Apologize for himſelf, addreſſing that Diſcourſe ſometime after to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> which may be ſeen at the Beginning of his Second Book of the Conſiderations. There it is that appearing perfectly looſned from himſelf, and ſolely faſtened unto God by an Ardent Love and mighty Zeal for his Glory, he ſaith, <hi>That it muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity happen, that men who generally make their Judgement of things in Proportion to their Events, muſt upon this ſad Occaſion fall into Diſcontents and Murmurings, but that it was a Satisfaction to him, to have them repine rather againſt him then againſt God; That he looked upon it as a very great Happineſs, that God was pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo far as to make uſe of him as a Buckler, by expoſing him to the furious Arrows of wicked men, and that he willingly received the Wounds of thoſe envenomed Darts, of Curſes, which in Reallity were ſhot againſt the Divine Providence; and that he was not at all diſpleaſed to have his own Reputation covered with Diſhonour, ſo long as it might in any meaſure redound to the ſecurity of God's Glory; that he wiſhed with all his Soul that he might glorifie God with</hi> David, <hi>in ſaying as he did.</hi> For thy Sake have I ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reproach, Shame hath covered my Face. <hi>And in ſhort that it was his Glory to be made like the Son of God, who ſaith to his Father by the ſame Prophet.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of them that reproached thee is fallen upon me.</p>

All the World knows that the Reaſon was from the People themſelves, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a thouſand Offences againſt God, during their murmuring Paſſage through the Deſert: and it muſt not be ſaid, that the Puniſhments which befel them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Promiſes, for thoſe being only Conditional and the perfect Effects of his Goodneſs, could not in the leaſt prejudice the Almighty Prerogative of his Juſtice.</hi> It is no more but making Application of this Example to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and there is his Juſtification. He preached the Cruſade by the Command of God, ſince he did it by the Expreſs Command of his Superiors, which was all that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it. He promiſed them happy Succeſs, and he promiſed it on Gods behalf. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it be demanded what Miracles I did to prove my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Miſſion, it is a Queſtion which my Modeſty will not permit me to anſwer, and my Baſhfulneſs in being unwilling to be my own Herald, ought to procure my Pardon. It is your part,</hi> adds he, ſpeaking to the Pope, <hi>It is your part, Holy Father, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for me, according to what you ſaw, and according to what you heard.</hi> And the natural Concluſion which he draws from the whole Diſcourſe is, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Succeſs of this Enterpriſe was wholly to be imputed to the Crimes of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and that it was no way repugnant to the Promiſes of God, which being Conditional could no more deprive him of the right of his Juſtice then the promiſe of a King to one of his Subjects to beſtow upon him one of the Chief Offices of his Crown, can indemnifie him from the Rigor of the Laws, if he ſhall before he obtains it be found guilty of High Treaſon againſt his Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>And certainly <hi>Otho Friſingenſis,</hi> who in this unfortunate Voyage accompanied the Emperor his Brother, avows upon his Reputation, that there were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſorders committed by the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and ſuch as well deſerved this terrible Puniſhment. And others affirm that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was blackned with ſo many Vices, and eſpecially moſt brutal Luſt, that it is no wonder if they drew upon themſelves the heavy Vengeance of Almighty God. So that if it be conſidered that the Crimes of theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſo great, and that the Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicted upon them was juſt, it muſt be great Injuſtice to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that the World ſhould accuſe him either of Malice or Treachery in preaching up the <hi>Cruſade.</hi> But this hath ever been the Deſtiny of Great Men, to ſuffer as well as do great things, that ſo their Vertue which is above the Praiſes and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of men, may expect them only from God himſelf.</p>

But Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which eſpecially among <hi>Infidels,</hi> does think nothing Criminal, that may advance their Deſigns, and judges all things Lawful which ſeem neceſſary to obtain Dominion, being his predominant Vice.

But at length, his Diſtemper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, he was obliged to chuſe ſome of the Nobility to Govern under him, and this Choice occaſioned thoſe Emulations and Diviſions in the Realm, which at the laſt completed its Ruin: For as when once a Soveraign Prince becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by Diſeaſes, to mannage his own Affairs; he uſually grows very Jealous and Suſpicious, and full of Fears to be Betraied by thoſe to whom he is obliged to truſt with ſo great a Charge; <hi>Baldwin</hi> ſeeing himſelf reduced to this piteous Condition, and fearing leaſt, <hi>Bohemond</hi> the young Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> ſhould attempt ſomething againſt him, under pretext of his Diſtemper, which rendred him unable to Govern in his own Perſon; he therefore, without that juſt Deliberation, which an Affair of that Importance required, gave <hi>Sybilla</hi> his Siſter, who was the Widow of <hi>William Longſword</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> in Marriage to <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> a young <hi>French</hi> Lord, the third Son of <hi>Hugh</hi> the Brown Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> who had made the Voyage by Sea with King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young; and creating him Earl of <hi>Jaffa</hi> and <hi>Aſcalon,</hi>

                  <p>Then it was Reſolved to ſend with all ſpeed a great Ambaſſage into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to deſire a quick and powerful Aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Saladin,</hi> who now began to puſh his Conqueſts even into <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> For this Purpoſe, Choice was made of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the two great Maſters of the Temple and the Hoſpital, who were then the two moſt conſiderable Men of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> both in regard of the Number, and the Valor of the Knights of theſe two Orders, who were now become moſt Powerful and moſt Famous throughout all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Theſe Ambaſſadors Arrived happily at the Port of <hi>Brindes;</hi> but their Negotiation was not anſwerably happy to that of their Voyage: For the different Intereſts of the Chriſtian Princes at that time, were ſuch as would not permit them to ingage in an Enterpriſe of ſuch Difficulty, as was the Leading of an Army of <hi>Cruſades</hi> into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as the Ambaſſadors deſired. <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> was ingaged in a War againſt the Cruel <hi>Andronicus,</hi> to take Vengeance upon that Tyrant, who had horribly Maſſacred all the <hi>Latins</hi> that were at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that ſo he might with greater Facility uſurp the Imperial Throne, by putting to Death the young <hi>Alexis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Manuel.</hi> Having therefore been able to procure nothing more from this Prince, beſides great Promiſes for the future, they croſſed through <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Verona,</hi> where Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> held a great Aſſembly of Princes and Prelates, to determine the Differences between them, and to ſettle the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Emperor, who was abſolutely reſolved to re-ſettle his Authority, which the Wars, during the Schiſm, which had been made with the Papal See, had ſo much weakned, gave them nothing but fair Words and great Hopes; and for the Pope, as he ever diſtruſted the <hi>Romans,</hi> who not long before had Revolted from him, he was able to do no more than to give the Ambaſſadors his Letters, to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> wherein he exhorted them to this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third his Predeceſſor had before to little Purpoſe done. The Patriarch therefore, and the great Maſters of the Hoſpitallers, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed their laſt Duty to the Maſter of the Temple, who Died at <hi>Verona,</hi> paſſed into <hi>France.</hi> There they were moſt magnificently Received and Treated by the Order of the King <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to whom they preſented the Keys of the Holy City, of the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> and the Holy Sepulchre, with the Royal Standard, in token that they put themſelves under his Protection, and to oblige him to Succor the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> as if it were his own Kingdom, now that it was reduced to ſuch extreme Danger by the <hi>Infidels.</hi> Whereupon a general Aſſembly of all the Prelates and great Men of the Realm, was called at <hi>Paris,</hi> to Debate this great Affair; and they conſidering that the King was not above eight and twenty Years of Age, and had no Iſſue, were of Opinion, That he ought not in Perſon to undertake ſuch a dangerous Voyage; only <hi>Philip</hi> promiſed the Ambaſſadors, that he would move his Subjects through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Realm to inrowl themſelves for this War, and that he would at his own Coſt, furniſh all thoſe liberally for their Maintenance, who would take up Arms for ſo Juſt and Holy a War. This Anſwer was not at all to the Satisfaction of the Patriarch; however he contented himſelf as well as he could, upon the Hopes which he had that the King of <hi>England,</hi> upon whom they did particularly rely in <hi>Syria,</hi> would make himſelf the Head of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
                  <p>That King was <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, the Son of <hi>Geoffry</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who had married <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, the Widow of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, ſhe was Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that this <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was Grand-child both to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, and to <hi>Fowk d' Anjou,</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who was the Father to <hi>Geoffry</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and to <hi>Amauri</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and by reaſon thereof he was Couſin German to <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Fourth, who was the late King of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> ſo that doubtleſs he was more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Obliged than any other Prince, to Defend that Realm which might one Day deſcend to him by Inheritance. He was alſo more eſpecially Obliged to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64918:77"/>it for the Expitation of the Crime which he had Committed,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1183</label> in permitting the Aſſaſſins of St <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to Murder him in his own Church; and he had accepted it as a Penance from the Pope, within three Years to lead an Army in Perſon to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> More than ten Years were already ſlip'd away ſince the Term prefixed, and he had not done any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Accompliſhment of his Promiſe; of which he was by a Letter from Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> reminded in Terms ſharp enough, who told him plainly, that it was impeſſible for him to eſcape the ſevere Judgments of God, who would not permit himſelf to be mocked, and whoſe Vengeance he would have cauſe to Fear, if he perſiſted willfully in the breach of his Promiſe. All theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made the Patriarch hope for more happy Succeſs to his Negotiation in <hi>England,</hi> in regard, that in this preſſing Neceſſity, it was probable, either that the King would go in Perſon into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of his Promiſe; or at leaſt, that he would ſend one of his three Sons to command the Army; and bigg with theſe Expectations, he croſſed the Sea with his Colleague, and in the beginning of the Year following came to <hi>London.</hi>

                     <hi>Henry,</hi> who was beforehand reſolved not to grant what the Ambaſſadours came to deſire, would nevertheleſs ſave his Reputation, and therefore he did them all the Honour imaginable, and took the moſt plauſible Courſes to juſtify his Conduct. He therefore ſent for them to <hi>Reading,</hi> where the Court then was, and gave them a moſt favourable Audience; He very graciouſly, and with great marks of Goodneſs and Compaſſion, heard the Patriarch <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who in a moſt paſſionate Diſcourſe, after he had preſented him with the Keys of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the Holy Sepulchre, repreſented the piteous Condition to which the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> were reduced, who he ſaid, ſtretched out their beſeeching Hands to him, who above all others, had ſo many powerful Reaſons, both Divine and Humane, to oblige him to take them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The King gave him Hopes, that he ſhould in a little time receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in what he had propoſed, aſſuring him with all the appearances of a great Sincerity, that with God's Help all ſhould go well, and that this Affair ſhould ſucceed to his Contentment: And in the Interim he conducted the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſſadours to <hi>London,</hi> there to attend the more particular Anſwer, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give them, after he had firſt, according to the Cuſtom, taken the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Prelates and Lords of his Parliament upon it, which he had ordered to be called againſt the firſt Sunday in Lent. And accordingly, he did not fail to call a Parliament, where, beſides the great Men of <hi>England,</hi> there were alſo preſent, <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his Brother, and the Lords of that Realm, which then was held of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Now the Patriarch, as the Pope in his Letter, and himſelf in his Speech had done, principally inſiſted upon the Promiſe, which the King made, when he obtained his Abſolution, to go in Perſon to the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> the King conſulted the Biſhops and the Abbots in the Caſe, to know whether, conſidering the preſent Circumſtances of his Affairs, he was obliged to aquit himſelf of his Promiſe, by accompliſhing that part of his Penance which was impoſed on him by the Pope, and to which he had ſo ſolemnly obliged himſelf. This certainly was a moſt nice and curious Caſe of Conſcience, and which ought in the firſt place to be decided; in regard, that if his Promiſe was binding, there was no longer place for Deliberation, and that he had but one Choice to make, which was, to acquit himſelf of it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the Voyage: If he was not obliged to that Condition of his Penance, then it muſt fall under Examination, whether of theſe two was moſt Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, either that the King ſhould aſſiſt the Orientals without going in Perſon out of the Kingdom, or that he ſhould himſelf conduct the Succours into <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> As for the King, to ſhew that his Proceedings were clear and with good Faith upon the matter, he would by all means, that the Patriarch and the great Maſter, ſhould themſelves Aſſiſt at the Debate, while this Queſtion was under Deliberation, with full and intire Liberty, there to offer what they ſhould judge Convenient. And withal, he ſtrictly required of all that aſſiſted at that Aſſembly, that they ſhould faithfully give their Opinions, without any ſort of Complaiſance to him, and declare their Judgment upon their Conſciences, which of theſe two was moſt expedient and neceſſary for his Souls Health

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1185</label> proteſting that he was firmly reſolved to put in Execution what ſhould be determined by the Plurality of Votes in that Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>The more ſevere Opinion aſſuredly was, That the King ſhould abide by his Word and Promiſe, that he ſhould accompliſh the Penance which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, and that he ſhould go in Perſon to the Succour of the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> and this the Patriarch failed not to ſupport with all the Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which could be alledged: For, urged he, What is there in all Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which ought to be more ſacred and inviolable, than the Word of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty King? Can there be any thing that ought more religiouſly to be obſerved, than a Promiſe made upon receiving the Holy Sacrament, at the Abſolution gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for an Offence, which was granted upon the Condition of accompliſhing the Penance which is accepted to ſatisfie God Almighty? And ſuppoſing that there could be a Diſpenſation, ſo as to change it to another; Who could give that Diſpenſation, or make that Exchange, except the Pope, who had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Penance; and who was ſo far from being willing to grant any ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, that he preſſſed the Performance of it in the moſt preſſing Terms, and with the moſt terrible Menaces of the Judgments of God, if the Satisfaction was longer deferred? Theſe Arguments, without doubt, appeared very ſtrong: Nevertheleſs, all the Biſhops and Abbots, among whom there were many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary knowing, and very good People; among others, <hi>Baldwin</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Man of moſt wonderful Merit; concluded with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conſent, for the more mild Opinion; and maintained, that the King was not only not obliged at preſent to undertake this Voyage to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but alſo, that it was more conducing to the Health of his Soul, that he ſhould ſtay to govern his Dominions; in regard that the Promiſe which he had made in accepting the Penance, was not only in its own Nature diſpenſable, but ought to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, becauſe nothing could oblige a Prince to the prejudice of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was made before it, and which was indiſpenſable, and by which the King, by his Coronation Oath, had obliged himſelf to govern his Subjects, and defend them againſt the Attempts of all their Enemies, both Foreign and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick; which it was impoſſible for him to do in his Abſence, in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where his Preſence could not be wanting. And for what concerned one of the Sons of the King, which was deſired in default of the King's going in Perſon, they all agreed unanimouſly with the Lords Temporal, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no power to determine upon it, in regard they were abſent; and that therefore the Reſolution which was to be taken upon that Matter depended abſolutely upon their own Will and Pleaſure. And, in ſhort, they judged all together, that though the King had, of himſelf, a mighty deſire to go this Voyage, yet he ought not to undertake it without firſt conſulting the King of <hi>France,</hi> who, in reſpect of the Eſtates of <hi>Normandy, Guienne,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which he held in the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, was his Lord and Soveraign: But that notwithſtanding, he might give liberty to his Subjects to take up the Croſs, and undertake that Voyage upon the firſt Occaſion; and that the King ſhould advance a Sum of Money for their Support who ſhould undertake this War, who it was promiſed, ſhould follow ſhortly after.</p>
                  <p>This was the Reſolution which was taken in the Parliament of <hi>London,</hi> and with which the Patriarch <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who was of a very violent Humour, was ſo exaſperated, by thinking all his Hopes and Endeavours were loſt, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly threw off all manner of Reſpect which was due to ſo great a Prince, and treated him after ſo rude a faſhion, that it is impoſſible to excuſe it under the ſoft name of Zeal, as he endeavoured to perſuade the World. For the King, that he might ſweeten what ſeemed ſo harſh in this matter, was reſolved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to remonſtrate to the Ambaſſadours, whom he ſent for, the Reaſons which had moved the Parliament to come to that Reſolution, which they eſteemed ſo prejudicial to the Hopes of their Embaſſage: He informed them, that it was the fear they had, that the <hi>French,</hi> with whom they never continued long in Peace, would draw ſome advantage from his Abſence; as alſo, that they were not without Jealouſies and Suſpicious, that his own Sons, of whom they were not too well aſſured, might occaſion ſome diſturbance in the Realm: but that for his own particular, he would with all his heart, give fifty thouſand Marks
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64918:78"/>in Silver for the maintaining of the War,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1185</label> and that he would further oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to maintain all ſuch of his Subjects as would undertake that Enterpriſe. This certainly was very obligingly and advantageouſly offered by the King: but the Cholerick Patriarch, fiercely rejecting the Propoſition, told him very inſolently, <hi>That they had no occaſion for his Money, but for his Perſon; that they had more Gold and Silver than they deſired; and that they were not come ſo far, but to ſearch for a Man who wanted Money, as he did, and who therefore might, to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, make a profitable War againſt the</hi> Infidels; <hi>and that they did not ſeek for Money, which ſtood in need of a Man who was skilled in Military Affairs, and knew how to employ it in that War. And for you, Sir,</hi> added he, ſpeaking to him with an Air, as offenſive and diſobliging as was imaginable; <hi>You have hitherto reigned with abundance of Glory: But know, that God, whoſe Cauſe you have now abandoned, is about alſo to abandon you; and he will let you ſee what will be the Conſequence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paying him with Ingratitude, for all thoſe Riches and Kingdoms which you have not obtained, but by your Enormous Crimes. You have violated your Faith to the King of France, who is your Soveraign; and you make that your Excuſe to refuſe this War, that you are afraid he ſhould make War upon you: You have barbarouſly cauſed the holy Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>to be murdered; and yet, in Expiation of your Guilt, you refuſe to undertake this Holy War, for the Defence of the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>to which you had engaged your ſelf moſt ſolemnly upon the bleſſed Sacrament.</hi> And then ſeeing the King change Colour, and bluſh with Madneſs and Anger; <hi>Never believe,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued he, thruſting out his Neck; <hi>Never believe that I have the leaſt Apprehenſion of the Effects of that Fury which glows about your Cheeks and Eyes, and which the truth of what I have ſpoken, which you cannot endure, hath kindled in your Soul; there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Head. Treat me as you have done St.</hi> Thomas: <hi>I had rather die by your Hand in</hi> England, <hi>than by that of the</hi> Saraſins <hi>in</hi> Syria, <hi>ſince I eſteem you little leſs than a barbarous</hi> Saraſin.</p>
                  <p>In truth, this extravagant, raving Language in a Patriarch, and a Patriarch-Ambaſſadour, was both inexcuſable and inſupportable; but the King, whoſe Age and Experience, and the dangerous Conſequences which had followed upon the death of <hi>Becket,</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had rendred more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, made a great Attempt upon himſelf, and generouſly ſurmounted his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though the Patriarch went on, ſtill vomiting out of indecent Reproaches, worſe than before, which I am aſhamed to relate. And when the Tranſport, into which the old Prelate had put himſelf was over, and that he began again to be in a tolerable Humour, the King did not, for all this, fail to treat him with abundance of Sweetneſs and Civility, till ſuch time as he carried him over in his own Ship to <hi>Roan;</hi> where, after the Celebration of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> he went with him to the Frontier, that ſo he might be a Witneſs of the Conference which was held for three days with King <hi>Philip,</hi> upon the Subject of this Holy War. But for all that, the Patriarch was no more ſatisfied than he had been before; for the two Kings remained fixed in their Reſolution, and both together infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that their Affairs would not permit to be ſo far and long abſent from their Dominions, but that they were both willing to aſſiſt him with ſuch Stores of Men and Money, as might defend them againſt all the Power of <hi>Saladin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus it happened at the laſt, that <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who had made no ſcruple while he was in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but he ſhould bring along with him, either the King of <hi>England,</hi> or one of his Sons, was forced to return, not only without them, but without the Succours alſo which were offered him, which out of madneſs he fooliſhly deſpiſed, contrary to all the Rules of Prudence and Reaſon, and to the mighty prejudice of the declining Affairs of his Maſter. So much doth it import Princes, not to abandon their Affairs and Intereſts to the Diſcretion of thoſe who have ſo little themſelves, as to ſuffer their unruly Paſſions to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them ſo abſolutely, as to loſe even that little which they have. It is true indeed, that after all this, the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Lords of <hi>England, Normandy</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the other Provinces which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>France,</hi> took up the Croſs, as ſoon as the Soldiers which <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> had levied, in order to the ſending them to the Succour of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But this beginning of a <hi>Cruſade</hi> turned to no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64918:78"/>great account; not only becauſe the two Kings did not at all engage in it,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1185</label> but alſo becauſe the Peace which was made between them, was ſhortly after broken; the occaſion of which, and the renewing of the War, happened to be, by the Refuſal of <hi>Richard,</hi> the Son of the King of <hi>England,</hi> to do the Homage which he ought to have rendred to King <hi>Philip,</hi> for the Earldom of <hi>Poitou,</hi> which he held of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by that ancient Tenure: as alſo, by reaſon that King <hi>Henry</hi> refuſed to reſtore the Earldom of <hi>Giſors,</hi> after the death of the young <hi>Henry,</hi> his eldeſt Son, to whom it was given in Dowry with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Lady, the Siſter of <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> upon Condition that it ſhould revert to that Crown if <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould dye without Iſſue, as he did three Years after his Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which was ſo furiouſly attacked by an Enemy ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as <hi>Saladin,</hi> remained deſtitute of all Aſſiſtance; and that which was ſtill more deplorable was, that this ſad Relation being reported throughout <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> by the Indiſcretion of the Patriarch, ſtruck the whole Country with ſuch an univerſal Conſternation, as produced a moſt dangerous Effect; for an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh</hi> Knight of the <hi>Temple,</hi> one <hi>Robert de St. Alban,</hi> a good Captain, but an ill Man, who had neither Religion, Honour, nor Conſcience; believing, upon this Report, that all was loſt as to the Chriſtians, and that he could no longer hope to eſtabliſh his Fortune amongſt a ruined People, he began to think of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it among the <hi>Saraſins;</hi> and to make himſelf conſiderable, in meriting well of <hi>Saladin,</hi> though by the blackeſt of all Crimes. This infamous Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rendred himſelf to that Prince, offering him his Service againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and promiſed him, that in a little time he would deſtroy them, and alſo take the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the Weakneſs whereof he was perfectly acquainted: And that he might give him ſuch Aſſurance of his Truth as was unqueſtionable, he alſo added, That he was ready to renounce his Religion, and turn <hi>Mahometan. Saladin,</hi> who very well knew him by the Reputation which he had acquired, and which had given him the Fame of one of the ableſt and moſt valiant Knights of his Order, accepted his Offers; and to engage him the more ſtrongly to his Party, gave him his Niece in Marriage, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a very good Army, with which this infamous Apoſtate committed moſt horrid Diſcorders in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but as he approached to <hi>Joruſalem,</hi> which he believed he ſhould be able to ſurprize with the third part of his Troops, whilſt the other deſolated all the Country as far as <hi>Samaria,</hi> or <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> even to <hi>Jericho,</hi> the ſmall number of Soldiers which were in the City, with the Inhabitants, ſallied out at the Poſtern-Gates ſo luckily, that the Traytor, who expected no ſuch matter, was himſelf ſurprized, and moſt of his Companions being cut in pieces, he was conſtrained to ſly with all the haſte his Spurs could help him to, thereby to eſcape the juſt Puniſhments which he knew he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his deteſtable Perfidy. This was ſome little Conſolation to poor King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who had taſted little in his Life, but went out of the World ſome few Days after, with this ſmall Satisfaction; dying in the twenty fifth Year of his Age, and the twelfth of his Reign; not leſs with the Violence of his Diſeaſe, than with the Grief which he had, to ſee his poor Kingdom deſtitute of all hopes of Succour, and left in the hands of a feeble Infant, betwixt eight and nine Years of Age; and which was in extream danger to be miſerably torn in pieces, by the Factions and Ambition of the Great Men.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, preſently after the death of this Prince,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1186</label> thoſe dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts for the Regency began to break out, between the Earl of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> and <hi>Guy de Luſignan:</hi> But this Fire became a mighty Blaze by the death of the little King, which happened about ſeven Months after that of his Unkle, by a ſlow Poyſon which, it is ſaid, was given him either by Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who had ſome Pretenſions to the Throne; or as others believed, by his own Mother <hi>Sybilla,</hi> an ambitious and unnatural Woman, who was not able to ſuffer this little Infant to take from her the Hope of being a Queen. But let it be as it will, that the Malignity of Men's Natures, and the Liberty which they give themſelves, to publiſh their own Suſpicions, and the idle Reports of the People, for undoubted Truths, which hath often given Riſe to the Belief of ſuch ſuppoſed Crimes: This is certain, that the death of this Infant King gave
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64918:79"/>the fatal Blow to this unhappy Kingdom,

Nevertheleſs, <hi>Sybilla,</hi> who was altogether as dexterous as ſhe was ambitious, having for ſome time concealed the death of her Son, knew ſo well how to gain the Patriarch, and the great Maſters of the Temple and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, who made the moſt powerful Intereſt, that ſhe procured her ſelf and Husband to be crowned, almoſt at the ſame time that the death of the little King was divulged, before the other Pretenders could have the leiſure to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize any thing againſt her. It is true indeed, that they were ſo tranſported with Madneſs at this ſurprizing Artifice, that they offered to declare <hi>Alfred de Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> King; but whether it were that he had little Ambition, or little Courage, he rejected the Tender, and went himſelf immediately to recognize the new King, by doing him Homage; the others thereupon, being aſtoniſhed with his Action, yet followed his Example, though they deteſted in their hearts this Cowardly Submiſſion of his, as they termed it, and reſerved themſelves for the future, by ſome Opportunity or other, to overthrow that Throne, to which they now ſubmitted only in Appearance, and Compliance to the preſent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. But it was far otherwiſe with the Earl of <hi>Tripolis;</hi> for he, neither able to ſuffer, nor to diſſemble the Injury, which he thought he received by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Rival, was ſo tranſported with Rage and Fury, that he immediately retired into his own Eſtates; and preſently after, to accompliſh his Revenge, committed a Fact, the moſt black, diſhonourable and deteſtable, that ever was recorded in any Story. This Count <hi>Raymond</hi> the Third was deſcended in the Right Line from the famous <hi>Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who was his third Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and who, after he had done ſo many fair Actions in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> died in the Year 1105. in the Fortreſs of Mount <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> about two Miles from <hi>Tripolis,</hi> which he then beſieged. <hi>Bertrand,</hi> his Son, who took that City, ſucceeded his Father in the Earldom, which he held of the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and he left for his Succeſſor, <hi>Pontius de Tholouſe,</hi> his Son; who married <hi>Cecilia,</hi> the Widow of the valiant <hi>Tancred,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> which he had by <hi>Bertrada de Monfort;</hi> who had alſo had by <hi>Fowk d' Anjou,</hi> her former Husband, the young Count <hi>Fowk,</hi> who was afterwards King of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> From this Earl <hi>Pontius</hi> and <hi>Cecilia,</hi> deſcended <hi>Raymond</hi> the Second, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to King <hi>Fowk;</hi> and who was alſo his Brother in Law, by the Marriage of the younger Siſter of Queen <hi>Meleſintha,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and Wife of King <hi>Fowk.</hi> So that <hi>Raymond</hi> the Third, of whom I now ſpeak, who was the Son of <hi>Raymond</hi> the Second, was, by his Father, ſecond Couſin; and by his Mother, Couſin-german to King <hi>Amauri,</hi> the Father of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billa,</hi> and Unkle to the little King deceaſed. Being of this Illuſtrious Blood, he had alſo Qualities anſwerable to the Greatneſs of his Birth: for he was wiſe and judicious in Counſel; prudent, moderate, grave, ſerious, and extream ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſpeaking little, and very reſerved, though he had a Spirit quick and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64918:79"/>piercing, and was of a mighty Courage, and undaunted Boldneſs:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1186</label> He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready, and even eager in the Execution of what he undertook, as too well appeared in the Battle of <hi>Harenc,</hi> which he and the Prince of <hi>Antioch</hi> loſt to <hi>Noradin;</hi> wherein he was taken Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Alepo;</hi> where he continued in Captivity for eight Years, paying for his Ranſom twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, the greateſt part whereof he received from the King <hi>Amauri.</hi> As for the reſt, he was wonderful cunning, civil, popular, and artificially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant to thoſe with whom he had to do, but ſierce and ruggid to his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, where he acted without Conſtraint, according to the Dictates of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe Temper, which made it ſelf known for Saturnine and Melancholy, by the Habit of his Body, which was thin, large and meagre, his Viſage melancholy, his Complexion ſwarthy, his Hair black and lank, his Noſe hooked, his Eyes quick and fiery, his whole Phiſnomy ſierce and gloomy, which, in deſpight of all the Art which he made uſe of to ſweeten it, made too viſible Appearances, that he had at the bottom of his Soul, thoſe untamed, tumultuous and violent Paſſions, which were capable of tranſporting him to the laſt Extremities of Rage and Wickedneſs, as made themſelves manifeſt in that fearful manner which I am about to relate.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Saladin,</hi> who was diligent in watching how to make his Advantage of theſe Diviſions among the Chriſtian Princes, the noiſe of the Rupture being come to his knowledge, ſecretly ſent to Earl <hi>Raymond,</hi> with whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſome Correſpondency. He ſollicited him to joyn their Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> and promiſed him to ſet him upon the Throne of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to aſſiſt him with all his Power, to maintain him there, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that, for the Security of his Fidelity, he would renounce Chriſtianity, and embrace the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> There are few Examples in Hiſtory which make it more apparent, into what a fearful Abyſs of Blindneſs and Madneſs the violent Paſſions of Jealouſie, Ambition, Hatred and Revenge precipitate a Man, who hath once ſo far abandoned himſelf to them, as no longer to give ear to Reaſon, Honour and Conſcience, which oppoſe them. <hi>Raymond,</hi> who was reſolved, at any rate, that his Rival ſhould periſh, and who had no other Thoughts, but how to gratiſie his importunate Paſſions, though at the Expence of the greateſt Crimes in the World, and the Damnation of his Soul; without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weighing the the Shame, or the Danger, into which, in all ſenſes, he was plunging himſelf, in giving Credit to an Enemy, and an ambitious Infidel; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all that <hi>Saladin</hi> deſired, provided that he would follow his Direction, and enter into the Realm with a powerful Army when it was a convenient time, by the Way which he ſhould adviſe. He therefore acquainted him only with his Deſign; which, that it might proſper, was to be enterprized in this manner, as he had before contrived in his Imagination: There was a neceſſity that he muſt for the preſent diſſemble the Change of his Religion, of which nevertheleſs he aſſured him, that he would turn <hi>Mahometan;</hi> as alſo, that it was neceſſary that he ſhould conceal his implacable Hatred to his Enemy, by pretending a perfect Reconciliation with him, that ſo he might more eaſily deſtroy him, when he ſhould not have the leaſt ſuſpition of him. And therefore <hi>Saladin,</hi> who alſo had his deſign to deceive him, after he had made uſe of him for his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, having highly applauded and approved of his Artifice; this Traytor, ſeeming to have recovered his Tranſports, and now to be a true Penitent, acted with ſo much Cunning, and ſo deep Diſſimulation, that by the Mediation of ſome of the principal Lords who were of his Confederacy, and not in the leaſt ſuſpected by the King, he made his Peace with that poor Prince, who was raviſhed with Joy to think that now he had nothing more to fear from an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo potent and dangerous; who, being now reconciled, and returned to his Duty, might make him alſo hope to receive conſiderable Services from him.</p>
                  <p>Thus did he, as it were, deliver himſelf bound, Hand and Foot, into the Power of his mortal Enemy, who had ſworn his Ruin, and who had already ſold him to <hi>Saladin:</hi> For <hi>Raymond,</hi> who had married <hi>Eſchina,</hi> the Princeſs of <hi>Galilee,</hi> the Widow of the Count <hi>de Bures,</hi> the Conſtable of the Kingdom, which was the Daughter of <hi>Hugh de</hi> St. <hi>Omer,</hi> to whom King <hi>Baldwin</hi> had given that Principality, was by that Marriage, poſſeſſed of it; and having for the purpoſe,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64918:80"/>after his ſecret Treaty with <hi>Saladin,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1186</label> placed a very weak Garriſon there, he advertiſed him to enter by that way into the Kingdom. This the Conqueror ſalled not to do; and having firſt defeated the Troops of the Templers and Hoſpitaliers, upon the firſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> in a Combat wherein the Maſter of the Hoſpital and ſixty of the braveſt Knights ſell upon the place, he eaſily ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the greateſt part of the conſiderable Towns, which were left in a manner wholly deſenceleſs. And following the Advice which he received from Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> after his Accommodation with the King, he beſieged <hi>Tiberias,</hi> ſince called <hi>Tabary,</hi> with an Army of above fourſcore thouſand Horſe, and a great number of Foot. This was a ſair and great Town, anciently called <hi>Cenerth,</hi> ſituate upon the Weſt of the great Lake of <hi>Ceneſareth,</hi> or the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch, after he had magnificently rebuilt it, and ſortified it with ſtrong Walls, and good Towers, had given to it the Name of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> after the Name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor then reigning. Now the Earl having left a very ſlender Garriſon there, <hi>Saladin</hi> attacked it without any difficulty, and took it; all that the Princeſs <hi>Eſchina,</hi> who knew nothing of the Treaſon of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was able to do, being to ſave her ſelf by retiring into the Fortreſs, with thoſe ſew Soldiers which ſhe had to defend it, in Expectation of the Succours, which ſhe ſent inſtantly to deſire from the King.</p>
                  <p>Upon this News, the Council was divided in their Opinions. The more Wiſe and Prudent were utterly againſt attempting to relieve the place by main Force, in regard, <hi>That this could not be done, but by drawing the Garriſons out of the other Cities, to re-inforce the Army, which, without them, was too weak to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo great an Enterpriſe; and that this was, in effect, to expoſe the whole Realm to inevitable Ruin, in caſe they ſhould loſe the Battel.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> who would not loſe ſo fair an Opportunity to accompliſh his Treaſon, vehemently oppoſed that Opinion; and maintained, <hi>That there was an abſolute neceſſity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the Relief of the Fortreſs of</hi> Tiberias: <hi>That it was to loſe all, to loſe their Honour, by ſuffering the Princeſs, his Wife, who ſo bravely defended it, to periſh, whilſt they ſtood cowardly looking on: And that all the other Cities deſpairing, after ſuch an Example, to be relieved, would inſtantly ſurrender to the Conquerors, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Fortune of</hi> Tiberias, <hi>if it ſhould be taken. And for any thing elſe, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Garriſons from the Cities, they ſhould thereby have ſo good an Army, and ſo numerous, that there could not be any room for Fear, but that they ſhould beat that Enemy, whom they had ſo often vanquiſhed with far leſs Forces.</hi> The four Sons alſo of the Princeſs <hi>Eſchina;</hi> which ſhe had by her firſt Husband, made a mighty Noiſe; and with repeated Inſtances, demanded Relief to be ſent to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Queen <hi>Sybilla</hi> alſo employed for this purpoſe, all the Power which ſhe had over the Spirit of the King, her Husband, who was indeed her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that, in concluſion, the greateſt part of the Lords inclining to this Opinion; ſome out of Complaiſance to the Queen, others out of Service to the four Princes of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and divers out of the deſign which Count <hi>Raymond</hi> had ſecretly communicated to them; it was reſolved, that they ſhould march di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Enemies, with all the Forces which they could draw out of the Garriſons; where none were to be leſt, but ſuch as were incapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms. And thus with theſe Troops, which were compoſed of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, and a few Soldiers; the Army conſiſting in twelve thouſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot, beſides the Citizens, who were compelled by Force to ſerve in the War, they advanced towards <hi>Tiberias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as <hi>Raymond,</hi> who in Right of the Princeſs, his Lady, was Prince of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> was better acquainted with the Country than the reſt; and that he was not only eſteemed a great Soldier, but that he ſeemed alſo to have the greateſt Intereſt in the Victory, which was to deliver the Perſon which ought to be the deareſt to him, the Conduct of the Army was unanimouſly committed to him. That perfidious Traytor, who gave ſecret Advertiſement of all things to the Enemies, unfortunately, or rather maliciouſly engaged them in a rude and ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril Country, among the Straits of the Rocks and Mountains, where there was neither Water nor Forrage. The Enemies, who only waited for this lucky Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, failed not to encompaſs them with their Troops, which were far more numerous, after the ſame manner that the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſome time been incloſed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64918:80"/>in the <hi>Furcae Caudinae,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1187</label> which were not more Famous by the Shameful Ignomony into which the ignorance and the Temerity of their Captains there precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Soldiers, then theſe Straits, for the deplorable Overthrow of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, which was betrayed into the Hands of the <hi>Infidels</hi> by the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Perfidious Conductor.</p>
                  <p>It was now high Summer, in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> when the Heats of that Burning Climate are moſt inſupportable: and there was not one Drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be found among thoſe Rocks, ſo that the Men and Horſes died with Thirſt, and were able to do no more; there was therefore a Neceſſity of reſolving immediately to ſight the Enemy. For though the Diſadvantage was very great by reaſon that it was impoſſible to draw up the Army in Battalia, in a Poſt which was ſo uneven and ſo ſtrait and broken with Rocks, that they could not attack the Enemy, but by filing off, yet it was impoſſible to avoid that Choice; the Army was divided into a great many Bodies commanded by the Principal Lords, who were to follow one another, who were to ſuſtain there Companions, and who were reciprocally to be ſuſtained by thoſe which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. The Enemies expected them in good Order to cut them off, as they marched in theſe long Files, before they ſhould have Leiſure to form themſelves into Squadrons upon the Plain, to give them Battle. The great Maſter of the Temple who choſe to have the Van with his Noble Knights, advanced firſt, and charged ſo furiouſly upon thoſe Enemies which oppoſed him, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning them upon thoſe who followed them he put them into Diſorder, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that theſe Gallant men, who fought moſt Valiantly after the Example of their Captain, killing, overturning, or putting to flight all that durſt oppoſe their firſt Fury, had they been ſuſtained by the other Bodies, who had Order to follow them, the whole Army might with little Difficulty have been drawn from that diſadvantageous Poſt, and have had the Liberty of ſighting in the Plain Field, where they would doubtleſs have been able to have hoped or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſputed for the Victory; but here it was that the deteſtable Treaſon of the Perfidious Earl of <hi>Tripolis</hi> made it ſelf moſt infamouſly Viſible; For he had ſo ordered the Matter, that he himſelf commanded that Body which was to follow the Templers, and he had alſo diſpoſed the other Troops in ſuch manner, that all the Lords who were of his Party were to follow him. Now theſe Traytors would not advance, alledging that this was to lead their Souldiers to a perfect Butchery, to quit their advantageous Poſt and to march them thus in Files into the Plain, which was all covered with the Battalions and ſquadrons of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who muſt needs cut them all in Pieces, taking them thus without Trouble one after another: So that theſe brave Knights, infamouſly abandoned by their Reſerves, and on every ſide ſurrounded by an innumerable Multitude of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> were all either ſlain upon the Place, or taken Priſoners, not ſo much as one of them eſcaping.</p>
                  <p>After this Defeat, <hi>Saladin</hi> ſeeing that no more durſt advance to the Combat, approached to the Camp of the <hi>Christians,</hi> which yet he would not adventure to attack; but that he might complete their Diſpair by taking from them all Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Poſſibility to draw themſelves out of that wicked Strait, he cauſed Fires to be made in the Woods, which invironed the greateſt Parts of thoſe Rocks, and ſet ſtrong Guards upon all the other Avenues, that ſo he might ſight them with greater Advantage if they ſhould endeavour to Retreat, But ſix Fugitives, who run to his Army, and to gain Credence with him, offered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Saraſins,</hi> as they preſently did, having aſſured him that the Chriſtian Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were half dead with Hunger and Thirſt, and under the greateſt Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo oppreſſed with their Misfortune, Wearineſs and Deſpair that they were ſcarce able to ſtand or go; upon this Advice he inſtantly reſolved to Charge them; which he did with that Succeſs, that his Army powering in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Straits which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had abandoned, they fell upon theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable People, who were crouded together, and who had neither Courage to defend themſelves, nor Power to fly croſs the Flames and the Rocks, that it was no longer a Combat, but a Horrible Butchery and Slaughter: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Captains and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldiers, either periſhed in this miſerable Day, or were taken Priſoners. Few there were who ſaved themſelves by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64918:81"/>Flight,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1187</label> except the Perfidious <hi>Raymond</hi> and his Complices, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eſcape. The King ſeeing that all was loſt, thought to have ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by flying, but <hi>Tokedin</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Saladin</hi> purſued him ſo quick that he took him Priſoner, as alſo the true Croſs, which <hi>Rufin</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> according to the Cuſtom, carried that Day in the Battle. That Biſhop was armed with a Curiaſs contrary to the manner of all the other Prelates, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had carried that Holy Wood unarmed, not ſo much as one of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving even been wounded, whereas he notwithſtanding his Armour, was ſhot quite through the Body with an Arrow, wherewith he loſt both his life and the Croſs which he carried. <hi>Tokedin,</hi> who took it, when he brought the King a Priſoner before his Uncle, preſented that alſo to him as the moſt Glorious Trophy of his Victory.</p>
                  <p>There never was any Victory, more ſad and deplorable to the Vanquiſhed or more complete and advantageous to the Vanquiſhers; a Victory which made the Conquerors Maſters of all the rich Equipage of ſo many Princes and great Lords, as were either Slain or taken in that Battle. And as <hi>Saladin</hi> had a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Hatred to the Knights of the two Orders, of the Temple and the Hoſpital of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he cauſed the Heads of all of them who were found among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to be cut off in his Preſence, excepting only the great Maſter of the Temple; ſo that he almoſt extinguiſhed the whole Orders of them that were in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> for not one of theſe Valiant men had once offered to fly, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them periſhed Nobly with their Swords in their Hands during the Combat. He alſo with his own hand ſlew the Brave <hi>Renaud de Chattillon,</hi> who after having a long time governed the Principality of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Heireſs whereof, the Princeſs <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> he had married, was ſince that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Countries beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> where he had ſo often arreſted the Courſe and of <hi>Saladin</hi>'s Victories. This Prince who otherwiſe was a Perſon of great Humanity, when his Anger did not transport him beyond his Reaſon, yet could not bear with this Valiant man, who being by him briskly and with a little inſulting over his Misfortunes, demanded ſome Queſtions, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with an Air as Fierce and Haughty as the other ſpoke to him, inſomuch that the Liberty which he ought to have admired in a man, whoſe Courage neither his Misfortune nor his Chains could abate, provoked him to that Degree that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting himſelf, he cut of his Head with a Blow of his Cimiter, diſhonouring his Victory by that Brutal Action, which was ſo altogether unworthy of ſo great a man as he otherwiſe was. And thus by this unmanly Action he made it appear, that it was more difficult to vanquiſh himſelf than to overcome his Enemies. As for the reſt, whether it were that he repented of ſo ſhameful and cruel a Tranſport, or that his Avarice oppoſed his Cruelty; the Fear that he had to loſe ſo many great Ranſoms, which he might expect from ſuch conſiderable Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, made him treat them with extraordinary Civility, eſpecially the King, the Great Maſter of the Temple, and the old Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Father-in-Law of Queen <hi>Sybilla,</hi> who being come a little before to Viſit the Holy Places would needs make one in that unfortunate Battle.</p>
                  <p>But this was the ſmalleſt Fruit which <hi>Saladin</hi> drew from the gaining of this Memorable Day; for being a great Captain, as able, dexterous and diligent in making the beſt of a Victory, as he was Valiant and happy in gaining it; and that he knew that the greateſt part of the Cities were in a manner deſtitute of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and without Defence; he therefore immediately marched and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Victorious Army before <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> a fair and flouriſhing City whoſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was Neceſſary to receive the Fleet which was to come to him from <hi>Egypt.</hi> There were no Soldiers in the City, all thoſe which had been in Garriſon having been drawn out to recruit the Army, where they periſhed in that fatal Battle, and after ſo great a Loſs, there was no Expectation of any Succour for them; ſo that though it was a mighty ſtrong Place, yet it was ſurrendred to him in two days, upon the Aſſurance which he gave to the Native Inhabitants, that he would treat them moſt favourably, and that the <hi>Latins</hi> ſhould have Liberty to retire whither they pleaſed, and that there ſhould not be the leaſt Injury offered either to their Perſons or Goods, which they might carry away with them. He did moſt exactly keep his Word with them; and the Reputation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64918:81"/>which he had gained, of being a juſt, merciful and Generous Prince,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1187</label> together with the Inability which the other Cities found to defend themſelves, all the Forces of the Kingdom being ſo imprudently expoſed upon one ſingle Hazzard where they all periſhed, was the Reaſon, that in leſs than three Months all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities except <hi>Tyre, Aſcalon</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> yielded and ſubmitted themſelves to the Will of the Conqueror. He made ſome little Offer to beſiege <hi>Aſcalon;</hi> but ſeeing that Place, which was as the Bulwork of the Realm againſt <hi>Egypt,</hi> was extraordinary ſtrong and well defended, he was in the Opinion, that if he muſt imploy his Forces againſt theſe three Cities which remainded yet unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it was much better to begin with the Capital City: For he well hoped that after the taking of that the two others, ſeeing themſelves ſeparated from one another, at the two Extremities of the Kingdom, would quickly follow the Fortune of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was then about the middle of <hi>September</hi> that <hi>Saladin</hi> came to encamp before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the moſt powerful and numerous Army that he had ever before had; ſierce with his Victories and rich with the Spoils of the Vanquiſhed, and deſpiſing the pitiful Remainders of thoſe who were ſhut up in the Capital City, which he looked upon as the End of his Labours and the Subject of his Future Triumph. There was in the City, the Queen <hi>Sybilla,</hi> the patriarch <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and <hi>Renaud</hi> Lord of <hi>Sidon</hi> or <hi>Sajetta,</hi> who eſcaped from the Battle, and was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Accomplice in the Treaſon of Count <hi>Raymond.</hi> And that which without doubt was a very unlucky Preſage to this poor City, was, that beſides the frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Citizens who trembled to ſee ſuch a formidable Enemy at their Gates, there were but a very inconſiderable Number of Soldiers who had eſcaped the Defeat; and the Inhabitants of the little Villages and Neighbouring Burroughs who were come thither for Refuge. <hi>Saladin</hi> immediately cauſed the Beſieged to be ſummoned to ſurrender the City, propoſing to them Examples of others, who had experienced his Clemency, Equity, and that inviolable Fidelity with which he always kept his Word and Promiſe. He promiſed them alſo, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe advantageous Conditions which he had granted to others, and which he offered to them, he would confer greater Favours upon them, he would maintain the Priviledges, the Honours and the Dignities which they injoyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Kings. Theſe were honourable Terms, and though the Defendants had not overmuch Courage, yet they had ſome Shame left to prevent their yielding ſo ſoon. So that an Anſwer was given like men of Bravery, that they were reſolved to defend the Place to the laſt Extremities. But this Courage was not laſting being but counterfeit. For <hi>Saladin</hi> having for ten days together made continual falſe Attacks upon the Weſt, to draw thither the greateſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Defendants, did at the ſame time batter the Walls, where they were weakeſt and almoſt ruinous upon the North Part of the City: So that having made a large Breach, and that they ſaw he was now preparing for a General Aſſault, the Beſieged ſent out to him to capitulate upon the Fourteenth day of the Siege. <hi>Saladin,</hi> who was determined to take, not to ruin the City, admitted the Treaty and at laſt it was finiſhed though with Conditions much leſs favourable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous then thoſe which they were offered before. For now he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that every own ſhould redeem his Liberty, by paying a certain Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Poll-Money according to the difference of Ages and Conditions. That all the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> with ſuch as were deſcended from them, ſhould depart the City, and not be ſuffered to carry away any more of their Goods then what they could bear upon their Backs. And that no Chriſtians except <hi>Greeks, Syrians, Armenians</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> ſhould for the Future be permitted to inhabit there.</p>
                  <p>There never was a Spectacle more moving or more lamentable, then to ſee ſo many People of all ſorts of Conditions conſtrained to quit the Holy City, which their Fathers had ſo gloriouſly conquered; and for which they never before had that Tenderneſs and Paſſion as now that they muſt leave it: But this is the uſual Folly of Mankind, that they rarely perfectly know the Good things which they poſſeſs with Eaſe, till they are upon the Point of relinquiſhing them for ever. During the whole Night, which was to uſher in that Gloomy day of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nothing was to be heard, but the Groans, the Lamentations, and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64918:82"/>Howlings of Deſpair,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1187</label> the piteous Cries of the Women and Children, the men, the Youths and the Aged, who deplored the Misfortune of the Holy City which was now to be delivered into the Hands of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and their one Exile, which in thoſe ſad Moments, they could not but look upon as the greateſt of their Puniſhments. Above all it was the Greateſt Difficulty for them to leave the Holy Sepulchre, which they bedewed with their Tears, and gave it thoſe laſt Kiſſes, which were to bid it eternally farewel. Then was to be ſeen the weeping Mothers loaden with their little Infants, who muſt now march out before they could go; the Husbands ſupporting them with one Hand, and with the other leading thoſe which were but juſt able to go; the ſtronger carrying on their Backs, thoſe whom either Age or Weakneſs had made impotent; and the Remainder every one carrying the Money and the moſt portable of their beſt Moveables which they had, in this Order marched out of the City, every one loaden with ſomething which either Nature or Piety, Neceſſity or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity obliged them to take Care of.</p>
                  <p>In this time <hi>Saladin,</hi> who would not make his Entry into the City till all the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> were departed, obliged them by his Preſence to make the more haſt; for ſuch was the Vanity of this Proud and inſulting Conqueror, that he would himſelf aſſiſt at this deplorable Spectacle, which he conſidered as one of the faireſt Flowers in his Triumphant Gerland. The Patriarch with all the Clergy of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> marched firſt, in a Condition far different from that wherein he was accuſtomed to appear upon the ſolemn days, with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Wood of the true Croſs, which the Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> had formerly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and which was now unhappily newly fallen into their Hands again, under this unfortunate Prelate <hi>Heraclius,</hi> according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark which was pubickly made by one upon him, who juſtly reproached him with the Diſorders of his Life, ſo little conformable to the Sanctity of his Character. After him came the Queen <hi>Sybilla,</hi> accompanied with the two little Princeſſes, her Daughters, and all the People of Quality. <hi>Saladin</hi> who was Civil and Courteous, much above what could be expected from one of his Nation, who generally were not guilty of being over poliſhed in their Manners, deſcended from his Throne, and receiving her with abundance of Honour and Reſpect, gave her all the Conſolation ſhe was capable of in her great Misfortune; by the Hopes which he made her entertain of the Liberty of her Husband, upon a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Compoſition. He alſo, according to his Promiſe, gave her a good Convoy to conduct her and her whole Retinue to <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> whither ſhe reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. After this he ſaw the Common People paſs bye, whoſe ſad Equipage and miſerable Condition, and above all the Woful Cries of ſome Women, touched him ſo nearly, that the Generous Compaſſion which he had, made him in this Rencounter, do an Action, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians would have judged worthy of the Vertue of the <hi>Heroes</hi> of Ancient <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as in this general Grief and Sorrow, which ſadly appeared through the whole Company of theſe poor afflicted Exiles, he obſerved that the Women and the young Ladies of Quality, as well as the reſt, who had nothing of the noble Air, beheld him after a manner infinitely touching, whileſt with piteous Cryes, and their Hands ſtretched out towards his Throne, they ſeemed in that poſture of Suppliants to beg ſome Favor from him; whereupon he commanded all the Company to ſtop, and ſent to know of theſe Ladies, what it was which they deſired of him. They returned in Anſwer, that beſides the Subject of their Sadneſs and Affliction, which was common to them, with the reſt of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who were turned out of their Habitations, and this beloved City, they had ſomething which was more particular, having loſt in the Battle of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> ſome their Husbands, others their Fathers or near Relations, who poſſibly might be in the number of the Captives: They therefore moſt humbly Requeſted of his Majeſty, that he would not deprive them of that laſt Refuge which they had, after the loſs of their Eſtates, in the Perſons of thoſe who were ſo dear unto them, and ſo neceſſary to them in that Extremity of Miſery and Poverty, to which they now found themſelves reduced. Whereupon that generous Prince, who had nothing Barbarous except his Birth, when his Choler, to which he was too much a Subject, permitted him to be himſelf, was ſo nearly touched
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64918:82"/>with the Words, and the Tears of theſe poor afflicted Ladies,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1187</label> that he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, that diligent Search ſhould be made among the Priſoners, and that ſuch as they named, if they were found there, ſhould be imediately ſet at Liberty, and beſtowed upon their Interceſſions and their charming Tears: and while this was doing, he had the Civility to Diſcourſe with them with mighty Sweetneſs and Humanity, giving them Conſolation for their Loſſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them courageouſly to ſuffer the Diſgraces and Capri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And that he might comfort them like a great Prince, he accompanied the ſweetneſs of his Words with the Effects of a Royal Bounty; making every one of theſe young Ladies magnificent Preſents proportionable to their ſeveral Qualities, thereby puting them into a Condition, not to have much reaſon to complain of the Severity of their Fortune. This without all doubt was a moſt great and Heroick Action, which of it ſelf was very Glorious, but it appeared much more advantageouſly afterwards, by being oppoſed to the barbarous Brutality of the Earl of <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which cannot be ſufficiently deteſted; for having loſt all manner of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Virtue and Humanity, which he ſeemed to have renounced with his Religion, he by the moſt barbarous Avarice, ſo ſoon as theſe poor Exiles were arrived at <hi>Tripolis,</hi> cauſed to be taken from them all that little which the <hi>Turks</hi> had left them; which reduced them to that furious Diſpair, that a Woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, from whom he had Raviſhed by this horrible Robbery, all that ſhe had, except a little Inſant which ſhe carried upon her Shoulders, took the poor Babe, and to ſecure it from the Jaws of inevitable Famine, tranſported with Rage and Fury, ſhe threw it into the Sea, in the Preſence of this Apoſtate and unnatural Earl, upon whom ſhe diſcharged a thouſand terrible Imprecations, to draw down from Heaven the juſt Vengeance of God upon him. Nor was it long deferred, for preſently after, this unfortunate Prince met with the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to his horrible Crimes, to the Load of which he had now added this laſt. The manner was thus; preſently after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> finding that his Subjects had a Horrour and Deteſtation of him, and that <hi>Saladin,</hi> was ſo far from beſtowing upon him the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as he had promiſed, and made him hope, that he would now take <hi>Tripolis</hi> alſo, from him; he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Grief, or rather Rage, that running ſtark Mad and Diſtracted, he preſently after his Wits, loſt alſo his execrable Life. A rare and fearful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which plainly inſtructs us, that though Treaſon may be for ſome time advantageous to thoſe in Favour of whom it is committed, yet it never fails to render the Traitors Odious and Inſupportable; and that God himſelf, where Men either cannot, or will not puniſh it, commonly makes the Effects of it fall by ſome extraordinary and remarkable Stroak of his Juſtice, upon the perſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heads of thoſe who are guilty of that abominable Crime, which in effect, while it ſtrikes at his imediate Vicegerents upon Earth, is an Affront to his ſupreme Majeſty, who hath intruſted them with the Government of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saladin,</hi> after the departure of the <hi>Franks,</hi> was reſolved to enter into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in Triumph, which accordingly he did, with all the Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which he believed was moſt proper to heighten the Luſtre of his Victory, and the Conqueſt over all the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> He therefore entred it in the middle of his Army, which was inriched with the Spoils of the Vanquiſhed, and the Rewards with which this Conqueror, who gave away almoſt all to his Soldiers, was pleaſed to honour them. He was followed by the captive King, who by a ſtrange Reverſe of his Fortune, appeared a Slave in the ſame City, where but a few Months before he had commanded upon the Throne; then came the great Maſter of the Temple; the old Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Conſtable, with other great Lords of the Realm, who were taken Priſoners at the Battle of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias;</hi> and laſt of all, by twenty thouſand Priſoners which he had taken in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Rencounters, and which after his Triumph were ſent in Fetters to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> The firſt thing which he did, after he ſaw himſelf Maſter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was to aboliſh all the Marks of Chriſtian Religion in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> where, after he had cauſed it to be waſhed with Roſe-water mingled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

For he obliged the <hi>Syrians</hi> with a great ſumm of Money to redeem that Holy Church, to whom he left it intirely, after he had firſt deſpoiled it of all the rich Ornaments, and the precious Veſſels, which the Chriſtian Princes had there offered. He alſo afterward publiſhed an Edict, by which he forbid all Perſons to diſturb the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their Devotions, or to do any thing contrary to the Honour which was due to that Church. He further ſet at Liberty abundance of Captives, and commanded that all the Infirm and Sick Perſons which were in the famous Hoſpitals of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould be entertained and attended there as formerly, where he alſo left all the Friars Servitors of the Hoſpitals to take care of them; which ought to render the Name and Memory of this Inſidel Prince Glorious, whether it were that it proceeded from the natural Goodneſs of his Soul, or that he made uſe of it as a certain kind of Policy to win upon the Hearts of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> his new Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which had been ſo happily delivered from the Tyranny of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> by the Princes of the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> under the Pontificate of <hi>

After which, as the Conqueror believed that he could with eaſe, when he pleaſed, make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> which had put it ſelf into the Hands of the Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he went and laid Siege to the famous City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which by the Vertue and good Fortune of one Perſon, happened to be preſerved, in the manner which I am about to relate.</p>
                  <p>The moſt illuſtrious Houſe of the Ancient Marquiſſes of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which was deſcended from the Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> was at that time one of the greateſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt in <hi>Italy. William</hi> the Third, ſurnamed the <hi>Old,</hi> who was the Head of it, held the moſt conſiderable Rank among the greateſt Princes of his time for his Vertue, for his Eſtate, his Alliances with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the King of <hi>France;</hi> but above all, for the extraordinary Merit of four Princes, his Sons, which he had by the Marchioneſs his Lady, who was the Siſter of the Emperour <hi>Conrade.</hi> His eldeſt Son <hi>Boniface,</hi> received the Crown of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> as the Reward of thoſe famous Actions which he did after the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople.

Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with thoſe that belonged to the Court and the City Militia, made up a very good Army, with which he lead the Emperour againſt <hi>Branas,</hi> who was advanced within View of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Blaquerneſs;</hi> and in the Plain which is on the other ſide of that Suburb, it was that he gave Battle to the Rebels, with ſo much Vigour, and ſuch admirable Conduct, that he intirely defeated them; and having ſlain <hi>Branas</hi> with his own Hand, he cut off his Head and preſented it to the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>But he preſently after perceived that this Prince, according to the Cuſtom of great Men, who rarely love thoſe Perſons ſincerely, to whom they ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely obliged, was ſo far from rewarding his Services, that now he deſpiſed him, and that he would give him no other Portion with his Siſter, but the vain Title of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the Honour of wearing purple Shoes. Being therefore of a good fierce Temper, and beſides, not over delicate as to matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he reſolved to take hold of the firſt Occaſion to abandon him, which he alſo did, but in a manner, which certainly neither became him as a gallant Man, nor as a Chriſtian. He had taken the Croſs for the Holy War when he came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and there he underſtood the great Progreſs which the Arms of <hi>Saladin</hi> made in <hi>Paleſtine:</hi> Now the Emperour, who was advanced with a few Troops towards the <hi>Danubius,</hi> to begin the War againſt the <hi>Wallachians,</hi> had left him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to gather up the reſt of the Army, and preſſed him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe, to make haſt to joyn him with them: But he, reſolving to delude the Emperour in his turn, as he had been deluded by him, inſtead of going to joyn with him, he went aboard certain Ships, which he had cauſed upon ſome other Pretext to be rigged out, with all thoſe Troops in whom he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; making no Scruple either to forſake the Emperour or the Princeſs his Lady; but as if his Marriage had been null and void, he left her, and weighed Anchor for <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> without knowing any thing of the defeat of the Chriſtian Army, or the Captivity of his Father.</p>
                  <p>As he approached to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> a few days after it was Surrendered to <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> he was ſomething ſurprized that he did not hear the Bells, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be rung out, when any Chriſtian Veſſels were ready to enter the

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1188</label> but in a moment after he was more aſtoniſhed, when in the place of the Croſs, he perceived upon the Towers, all the Enſigns of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> by which he knew that the Town was reduced under the Dominion of the <hi>Inſidels.</hi> This made him take a ſudden Reſolution to ſail to <hi>Tyre,</hi> which was not diſtant above eight Miles from thence to the Northward. This City, ſo flouriſhing, and ſo celebrated for its Antiquity, for its Riches, and for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Seige which was enterprized againſt it by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who from an Iſland, which it was before, made it a Peninſula, joyning it by a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bank of Earth, to the firm Land of the Continent, was now under the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Conſternation, finding it ſelf without Defendants, and juſt upon the Point to run the ſame Fortune with <hi>Ptolemaïs.</hi> The brave Marquis who landed in the Critical Moment, and who had abundance of Courage, Reſolution, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, failed not to lay hold upon ſo fair an Occaſion to purchaſe, not only Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but ſo conſiderable a Fortune in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> by ſaving this renowned City. He therefore offered to defend them againſt all the Forces of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> with thoſe which he had brought, provided they would Obey him; and as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for preſerving of the City, which was ſo viſibly expoſed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme danger of falling under the Power of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for their Maſter and their Lord. All this was imediately conſented unto; and therefore to ſecure the City, the next day he cauſed diverſe of the Earl of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> his Complices, who were diſcovered to have a Deſign to ſeize upon the Fortreſs, to be hanged for their Treaſon: And in ſhort, he laboured with ſo much Diligence in repairing the Fortifications, by the help of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and thoſe who were retired thither from <hi>Ptolemaïs,</hi> and furniſhed it with all things neceſſary to ſuſtain a Siege, that he ſaw himſelf in a Condition to reſiſt all the Forces of <hi>Saladin.</hi> And that crafty Prince, fearing to receive an Affront before a City ſo well fortified, offered <hi>Conrade</hi> to give Liberty to the old Marquis his Father, and if he would put the Place into his Power, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe him with ſo great a Sum of Money, as ſhould exceed all that he could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope. But when he ſaw the Marquis ſo firm, that neither Pity, nor Intereſt were able to work upon him; he then reſolved to carry the Place by Force, and therefore attacked it by Land with all manner of Engines, and blocked it up by Sea with a mighty Fleet, to prevent the landing of any Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by the Shipping of <hi>Genoua</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> But all his Attempts became fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the Valour and good Fortune, and ſtrong Reſolution of the Marquis, who by two or three ſtout Sallies, which he made with great Succeſs, obliged the <hi>Turks</hi> to remove to a greater Diſtance: He alſo fitted out all the Shipping in the Port, and joyning with the Fleet of <hi>Margaritus,</hi> Admiral of the Royal Navy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he attacked the Fleet of <hi>Saladin,</hi> ad defeated it ſo intirely, that ſcarce a Ship eſcaped, but either taken, burnt, ſunk, or conſtrained, to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, to run aſhoar in the View of <hi>Saladin</hi> himſelf, who ſaw, but could not prevent the Misfortune; and now began to deſpair of Succeſs, ſince it was no longer poſſible for him to hinder the Succours which came from <hi>Europe,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at Pleaſure into <hi>Tyre.</hi> And there entred ſuch conſiderable Numbers of them, who expected the arrival of the Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> that <hi>Conrade</hi> had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Means, not only to eſtabliſh his Dominions, but alſo to carry the War among his Enemies, and to meet with the good Fortune in one Encounter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others to take one Priſoner of great Quality, who was exchanged for the old Marquis his Father, to whom he reſtored his Liberty by his Valour, much more honourably than he could have done by a fooliſh Pity of his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. But <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had a great Soul, and who was not much aſtoniſhed with an Accident, which he had in ſome meaſure foreſeen, nor ſurpriſed with this little Reverſe of his Fortune, to which the Prudence and the Succeſs of the greateſt Captains muſt ſometimes ſubmit, quickly repaired this Loſs by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into the Principality of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which he totally reduced in leſs than three Months under his Power: For he took more than twenty Places, and conſtrained the Capital City to come to Terms, by which they promiſed to ſurrender to him, if in a certain time they were not relieved by an Army of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> more potent than his.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1188</label> which was not theirs neither, but upon a Condition which might fail; <hi>Tripolis,</hi> where the King, who had nothing more left of his Kingdom, was retired after his Deliverance, and <hi>Tyre,</hi> which the Marquis <hi>Conrade</hi> had ſo unexpectedly preſerved. And that which was yet more Deplorable, was the Diviſion which happened between the King and the Marquis, who pretended to retain <hi>Tyre,</hi> as having juſtly acquired it; all the Men of Spirit were upon this divided into theſe two Parties, ſo that it was of great Advantage to <hi>Saladin,</hi> that he had delivered this unhappy King, who by this new Diſturbance, was the cauſe of the Loſs of all the reſt. Strange Revolution of Fortune, which in ſo ſmall a time made ſuch a prodigious Change in the Condition of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Inſidels!</hi> which though it may give one ſome Aſtoniſhment, yet to me it doth not ſeem mighty Difficult to aſſign the Cauſes, which therefore for a little we will indeavour to find.</p>
                  <p>For firſt; The <hi>Cruſades</hi> who founded the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe who after them atchieved thoſe glorious Conqueſts, altho they had their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their Failings, and were as other Men, ſubject to humane Infirmities, yet for the moſt, they were good in the main, Men who had a great Fond of Honour any Honeſty, ſolidly Devout, and ſtrongly inclined to the good of Religion, fearing God, and above all, moſt zealous for his Glory. Whereas, whether the Manners of their Succeſſors were by little and little corrupted by the contagious Commerce which they had with the Inſidel Nations, with which they were Surrounded; or that great Numbers of wicked People, who paſſed into the Holy, to ſave themſelves from the Purſuit of Juſtice, carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and left by their pernicious Examples, thoſe Crimes to their Poſterity, which they had eſcaped the juſt Puniſhment of. Moſt certain it is, that ſome ſmall time before the Fall of that Kingdom, the Lives of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and even of the Clergy themſelves, were ſo horribly Deſolute, that it is impoſſible without Horror, to repreſent the frightful Picture, which the Writers of thoſe Times, and thoſe who have Copied after them, have drawn of their Crimes. And I wiſh with all my Soul, that it were poſſible to efface and aboliſh the Memory of them, rather than with a kind of Scandal to expoſe them to the View of ſuch honeſt People, whoſe Modeſty may recoil at the reading of them. For this Reaſon, as God puniſhed the Offences of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom himſelf had conducted by ſo many Miracles into this ſame <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and that the Puniſhment which they had ſo juſtly merited, was the depriving them of their Empire, and delivering them into the Hands of the <hi>Philiſtins, Chaldeans,</hi> and other <hi>Infidel</hi> People, who were the Executioners of his Juſtice; ſo did he puniſh the horrible Crimes of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom he had brought into <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> by the victorious Arms of the firſt <hi>Cruſades,</hi> by depriving them of that Kingdom, and abandoning them to be Slaves to thoſe People whom their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had with ſo much Glory ſo often vanquiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But farther, to give ſome natural Reaſon for this Change, the firſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> were warlike and moſt valiant Men, accuſtomed to Fatigues, and ſuch as frankly expoſed themſelves to all manner of Dangers, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known to recoil, let the number of their Enemies which they were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, be never ſo Prodigious; they eſteemed it a Happineſs to dye Martyrs in combating gloriouſly for the Faith, and for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt: And the Orientals, againſt whom they fought, were at that time little skilled in Wars, cowardly, undiſciplin'd, and half-armed People, who were not able to abide above one Shock, as having nothing to truſt to but their Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which they ſhot at Rovers, and commonly rather ſlying than fighting: Whereas on the contrary, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> having exchanged with the <hi>Infidels</hi> for all their Vices, had alſo gotten their Cowardice, their eſſeminate and idle way of Living; loving Repoſe and Pleaſure, and hating the trouble of War, and the Severity of that Diſcipline, which is ſo neceſſary to a Soldier, and which they wholly neglected. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſins</hi> on the other hand, were become mighty Warlike under their victorious Sultans, <hi>Sanguin, Noradin, Syracon,</hi> and <hi>Saladin,</hi> who having learnt at their Coſt to arm themſelves like the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> with good Curiaſſes and ſtrong Lances, had alſo taught them to follow
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64918:85"/>their Colours,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1188</label> to fight hand to hand, and had inſpired them with Courage and Conſidence, both by their Examples, and the fortunate Succeſs of their Arms.</p>
                  <p>And in ſhort, The Conquerors of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> under the firſt Kings, were under one ſole Head, who uniformly governed the whole Body of his Eſtate and Army, which acted according to the Meaſures which he preſcribed, with a perfect Unity, without Diviſion, without diverſity of Intereſts, Inclinations and Opinions, as if the whole Army had been as one Man, according to the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo frequent in the Scripture. Whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſins,</hi> were then divided almoſt into as many particular Eſtates as there were Cities in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and therefore could raiſe no great Armies, but what muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by many Chiefs, who, for the moſt part, never accorded very well, by reaſon of the diverſity of their Opinions and Intereſts, which made them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually be overthrown, though they were incomparably the ſtronger in number of Soldiers than their Conquerors. But upon the falling of the Realm, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was compoſed of the Troops of diverſe Chiefs, thoſe of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> and the great Maſters of the Temple and the Hoſpital, who all of them had different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Deſigns, which did not at all agree one with the other. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all the Eſtates of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> bordering upon the <hi>Chriſtians, Egypt, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Meſopotamia,</hi> the Realms of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> were at that time united into one ſingle Monarchy, under the great <hi>Saladin;</hi> and ſo their Army had but one Captain and Head, who being moſt Wiſe and Valiant, gave one Impreſſion, and a conſtant regular Movement to this great Body, which did not act but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his poſitive Orders.</p>
                  <p>And certainly it is moſt particularly this Unity which hath always made great Armies Victorious, as may be ſeen in all Ages and Hiſtories, but was never more manifeſted than in this laſt Campaign, which was ſo glorious and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the King of <hi>France.</hi> For on the one part, the Emperour and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and great part of the Princes of the Circles of the Empire and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> being leagued and confederated againſt him had raiſed very ſtrong and numerous Armies to invade <hi>France,</hi> both by Sea and Land. On the other ſide, that King alone, without imploying any other Power but his own, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out himſelf, thoſe Orders which were with Fidelity Executed, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them, I do not ſay, from entring, but ſo much as approaching <hi>France:</hi> Beat them thoroughly to the very Iſlands; and in Perſon, by main Force conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one fair and large Province; and his Army alone in <hi>Flanders,</hi> under his auſpicious Fortune, commanded by the famous Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> having to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them three great Armies of the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> joyned in one Body under three Chieftains, yet cut in pieces their Rere, took their Baggage, raviſhed from them more than one hundred Colours, and ſhamefully chaſed them from before <hi>Oudenard,</hi> and purſued them beyond the <hi>Scheld.</hi> And there it was, that their Commanders, having at laſt the Leiſure to take Breath, and to complain one to another, were conſtrained to avow, by their Flight, which they diſguiſed under the name of a Retreat, that as there is but one Soul in one Body, to give it Life, Movement, and the Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe admirable Operations of a Man; ſo there ought to be but one abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarch in a Kingdom, and one General in an Army, to procure the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the People, and to inable them to triumph gloriouſly over all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which go about to trouble their Repoſe, or rob them of their Happineſs. But after theſe Reflections which I have made, according to my little Art in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, which poſſibly will not appear altogether Uſeleſs, or at leaſt Indivertive, it is time to return to my Subject, and purſue this Hiſtory of the <hi>Cruſade.</hi>

That they themſelves would, for Example, be the firſt who would take up the Croſs; and not only preach it by their Words, but by their Actions. That for this purpoſe, they would neither make uſe of Horſes, Mules, or Litters; but that they would conſtantly go on ſoot, ſo long as the Feet of the</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Saraſins <hi>defiled that</hi> Holy Land, <hi>which Jeſus Chriſt had ſanctified by his Preſence and ſacred Steps. That they would go in Perſon themſelves before the reſt into</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>without any other Equipage except the Croſs, and the Poverty of Jeſus Chriſt; living upon Alms. And laſtly, at their Return, that they would no more receive any Preſents from thoſe who had Affairs in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>but content themſelves with what was ſtrictly neceſſary for their living in that modeſt Way which was conformable to their Condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were their great Reſolves: And truly I am of Opinion, that without doing any Injury to the Memory of theſe good Cardinals, one may lawfully ſay, that their Devotion, in the Tranſports of its firſt Heats, carried them ſomething further, than the Limits of a holy Diſcretion would have preſcribed to them. Nor is it to be found in Hiſtory, that theſe brave Reſolutions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe Effects which they ſeemed to promiſe, and which might have been expected from them; poſſibly becauſe whilſt they would do too much, they did too little, by that Weakneſs, which is ſo commonly incident to Mankind to fall very much below, when they come to repent themſelves of having gone too high above thoſe juſt Meaſures which a wiſe Man, after he hath once taken, will be ſure in all things to obſerve moſt exactly.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Gregory</hi> ſeeing that it was impoſſibly that the Deſign of Succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Holy Land</hi> ſhould proſper, ſo long as the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were engaged in Wars among themſelves, he reſolved to ſend his Legates to bring them to an Accord; at leaſt, to conclude a Truce for certain Years: And that he might do ſomething on his part towards ſuch an excellent Work, he went in Perſon with the Deputies of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to accord the Differences which had occaſioned a War between them and <hi>Piſa:</hi> But as he laboured very happily in re-uniting theſe two potent Republicks, who in concluſion, embraced that Spirit of Peace, wherewith he endeavoured to inſpire them, he was ſeized with a Tertian Ague and Fever, which in a few days carried him off, in the ſecond Month of his Pontificate.</p>

                     <hi>Clement</hi> III. who in twenty days after ſucceeded him, confirmed all that he had done, and purſued the ſame holy Enterpriſe, with the very ſame Zeal. He was admirably ſeconded by the Negotiation of <hi>William,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who was come to implore the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes. This is that great Man, who with ſo much ſtrength of Judgment, writ the Hiſtory of the Holy War, which he continued till a little before the death of <hi>Baldwin</hi> IV. and who, after he had ſo often managed the greateſt Affairs of that Realm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was the Chancellor, was at laſt ſent Ambaſſador into the Weſt, upon the hope that he would negotiate in a different manner than the Patriarch <hi>Heraclius</hi> had done, whom he much ſurpaſſed in all manner of Abilities.

And ſo it was, that by the force of his Genius, and his Eloquence, he procured an Interview between them, in a Plain between <hi>Trie</hi> and <hi>Giſors;</hi> where they were uſed to meet, when they treated, one with the other. The two Kings met there, about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> accompanied with the Princes, Prelates and great Lords of both the Kingdoms: And there it was that the illuſtrious Archbiſhop employed all the Power of his Eloquence, and of his Wit, to repreſent in that Auguſt Aſſembly, <hi>The deplorable Estate into which the fatal Diviſions of the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Eaſt had reduced the Kingdom of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which the firſt</hi> Cruſades <hi>had, from ſo many barbarous and</hi> Infidel <hi>Nations, ſo gloriouſly conquered with their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arms.</hi> He then remonſtrated, <hi>That of four puiſſant Eſtates, which they had eſtabliſhed upon the Ruins of the</hi> Mahomitan <hi>Empire, and which extended the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>from</hi> Cilicia <hi>to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and from the Sea to the River</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, <hi>there remained nothing to them now, more than three Cities. That</hi> Antioch, <hi>diſpairing to be able to preſerve it ſelf by its own Forces, had already promiſed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, if it were not immediately relieved by thoſe of the West. That</hi> Tyre, <hi>without neceſſary Succours, was not in a condition to ſuſtain a ſecond Siege, having in the firſt loſt the greateſt part of its Defendants. That</hi> Tripolis <hi>was too weak to endure one; and could no longer remain in Freedom, than it pleaſed</hi> Saladin <hi>to preſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, to add it to his other Conqueſts. And that further, after ſo lamentable a Loſs as that of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the reſt of the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>there was great danger of loſing alſo the very Hopes which remained to the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in thoſe places, from whence they might take a Beginning to re-eſtabliſh the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus, if thoſe two Kings, the moſt potent of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>did not unite their Hearts, and their Arms, to run to the Relief of Chriſt and his Cauſe, of whoſe only Grace and Goodneſs they held all which they did poſſeſs.</hi> And, in ſhort, he ſaid upon that Subject ſo many pathetick things, and in a manner, ſo powerful, and ſo touching, that the two Princes, whether they had in a former Conference, which they had, agreed this, as one of the Articles of the Peace; or that God, in whoſe Hands are the Hearts of Kings, to change them in a Moment, by the extraordinary Working of his Power; it is certain that they embraced one the other mutually, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the whole Aſſembly; and did it with all the Marks of a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and a ſincere and cordial Friendſhip, as if there had never been any Subject of Diſcontent or Difference between them.</p>
                  <p>And at the ſame time might be heard on all ſides the confuſed Voices of a Multitude of People, who broak out into great Cries of Joy; and from every Quarter was to be heard, <hi>Long live King</hi> Philip; <hi>Long live King</hi> Henry: <hi>Let us go, Let us go to this War againſt the</hi> Infidels, <hi>under the Conduct of theſe two mighty Kings. Let us deliver</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and extirpate the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt. The Croſs, the Croſs; let it be given us; the Sign of our Salvation, and the Ruin of the</hi> Saraſins. Theſe Acclamations were alſo preſently followed with that happy Succeſs, which attended the Legation of this brave Archbiſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that the two Kings firſt preſenting themſelves, to receive the Croſs from the hands of the Legates, they were followed by <hi>Richard,</hi> the Son of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Poitou,</hi> who had voluntarily taken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Loſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but would now anew receive it from the hands of the Legates: As alſo did <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Blois, Dreux, Champagne, Perche, Clermont, Barr, Beaumont, Nevers; James</hi> Lord of <hi>Aveſnes,</hi> and almoſt all the great Lords of <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> who were preſent at this Aſſembly.

It is ſaid that at the ſame time there appeared one in Heaven, bright and ſhining, which helped to inflame the Devotion of thoſe who took up the other; as if God himſelf had manifeſtly called them to this Holy War by a ſacred Signal from above. And to render the Memory of ſo great an Action Eternal, a Croſs was erected, and a Church built in the midſt of the Field of this Conference; which was ever after called, <hi>The Holy Field.</hi>

That the</hi> Cruſades <hi>ſhould have liberty to raiſe a Tenth of all their Subjects who did not go to this War. And that the Husbandmen who undertook to go and take the Croſs, without the Leave of their Lords firſt obtained, ſhould not be exempted from this Impoſt. That all Intereſt upon Money lent, ſhould ceaſe for all the time that the Debters were upon Service in the</hi> Holy Land. <hi>That all Perſons might mortgage their Inheritances, or their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, for three Years; during which time, the Creditors ſhould peaceably enjoy them, whatever happened to the Owners. That all unlawful Games of Chance, all Swearing, Blaſphemy and Diſorders ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed.</hi> To which were alſo added very admirable Orders for the Regulation of Exceſs in Apparel, in the Tables, and the Retinues of the <hi>Cruſades;</hi> and above all, that except ſome old Landreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there ſhould no Women be ſuffered to go along with the Army, as had been permitted in the former <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and which had occaſioned great Diſorders.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ordinances were received, and ſolemnly publiſhed in both the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, where an infinite number of People enrolled themſelves for the Croſs; ſome out of Zeal, and true Devotion; others to be exempted from the Tax, which though it was conſented to by the Biſhops, in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was held this Year about <hi>Mid-Lent,</hi> yet there were ſome Eccleſiaſticks, who declared themſelves againſt it tartly enough: Among the reſt, <hi>Peter de Blois,</hi> one of the moſt knowing Men of his Age, writ againſt it to <hi>Henry de Dreux,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the King's Nephew, in very hard Terms; preſſing him to oppoſe this Ordinance of the King, which, he ſaid, was a Breach of the Liberties and Privileges of the Eccleſiaſticks; from whom, he pretended, no other Aids ever were or ought to be exacted, beſides their Suffrages and Prayers. But this Advice of this Archdeacon of <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> though otherwiſe an able Man, prevailed nothing upon the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> whom he ſomething too liberally accuſed of following too gentle and eaſie a Conduct: For they, as well as the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> with great Juſtice and Reaſon, as well as Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, believed that ſuch a part of the Goods of the Church might very lawfully be employed, upon ſuch an holy Occaſion, for the Deliverance of the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo many poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, and in a manner, all the <hi>Oriental</hi> Churches from the Oppreſſion and Tyranny of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> See now how Zeal, when it is a little over-heated, eaſily becomes ſo falſe and fooliſh, as to blind Men to that degree, that they are not able to ſee that for good Senſe, which common Reaſon alone, without other Theology, diſcovers ſo plainly to the whole World. Thus then all things were diſpoſed for a happy Beginning to this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> if the Diviſion which, in a little time after, broke out again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings, had not turned thoſe Arms againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they had before prepared, to fight againſt the <hi>Saraſins.</hi>

                  <p>Among other Articles which were agreed upon at this famous Conference in the Field of <hi>Giſors,</hi> it was ordained, That all Matters in difference on one part, and the other, ſhould remain in the ſame Eſtate wherein they ſtood before; and that no one ſhould enterprize any thing againſt his Neighbour, till ſuch time as the Holy War were determined. In this time, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> to the prejudice of a Treaty ſo ſolemnly made, concluded and ratified, renewing the ancient Quarrel betwixt him and Count <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> threw himſelf ſuddenly into that Count's Territories, and preſently took from him <hi>Cahors</hi> and <hi>Moiſſack.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1188</label> Philip</hi> alſo marched thither with his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Army, where he obtained great Advantages againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> till at length, a Conference for Peace was held near <hi>Bonmoulin,</hi> at which the Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi> with divers other Princes, continually importuned the King to conclude, proteſting to him that otherwiſe they would deſert him, for that they were reſolved to accompliſh their Vow in going to the Holy War. There never was any Conference managed with greater Dexterity and Policy, than this was by King <hi>Philip:</hi> For knowing perfectly the Humour and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Son, he only demanded that the Princeſs <hi>Alice,</hi> his Siſter, whom the late King, his Father, had deſigned to be married to <hi>Richard,</hi> and who was kept in Cuſtody by <hi>Henry,</hi> ſhould be put into the hands of her intended Husband, ſince they were now both of Age; and that <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould be declared joynt King of <hi>England</hi> with his Father, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Prince <hi>Henry</hi> had been, who had married <hi>Margaret,</hi> the eldeſt Siſter of the Princeſs <hi>Alice. Henry,</hi> againſt whom the Prince, his eldeſt Son, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>French,</hi> had formerly made a moſt cruel War, fearing leſt <hi>Richard,</hi> who was no leſs ambitious than his Brother, ſhould create him the ſame trouble; or poſſibly, having his Soul pre-poſſeſſed with another Paſſion, leſs excuſable, but more ſtrong than either Fear or Policy, would by no means agree to theſe two Articles. So that this Conference produced no other Effects, but only a Truce of a few Months during the Winter; and that which <hi>Philip</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, did not fail to happen, to his advantage, as well as according to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; for <hi>Richard,</hi> who was of a Temper extream ambitious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, was ſo exaſperated with this Denyal, that he inſtantly abandoned his Father, and paſſed into the Party and Intereſts of <hi>Philip,</hi> did him Homage for all the Lands which he held in <hi>France,</hi> and promiſed him an inviolable Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſerve him againſt all Perſons whatſoever, even his own Father; as he did.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, as ſoon as the ſhort Truce which had been made, came to be expired, which it did the next Spring, the King, with all his Forces, joyned with thoſe of <hi>Richard,</hi> who had drawn to his Party, beſides the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenins,</hi> his Vaſſals, many <hi>Angevins</hi> and <hi>Bretons,</hi> marched againſt <hi>Henry,</hi> who lay with a very few Troops at <hi>Saumur.</hi> But the Cardinal <hi>d' Anaigne,</hi> the Pope's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who ſucceeded in the place of the Cardinal <hi>d'Albano,</hi> who was dead not long before, negotiated ſo happily with the two Kings, that they promiſed to meet in <hi>Whitſun-Week,</hi> near <hi>Ferte-Benard;</hi> and there amicably to treat before him, and the Archbiſhops of <hi>Reims, Bourges, Rean</hi> and <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who were to decide all their Differences.

The Kings, and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> accompanied with all the Great Men of both Realms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the place deſigned for the Conference, <hi>Philip</hi> demanded as before, That his Siſter, the Princeſs <hi>Alice,</hi> who was affianced to Duke <hi>Richard,</hi> ſhould be delivered to him by King <hi>Henry,</hi> who, contrary to all Juſtice, had kept her from him: And that <hi>John,</hi> the third Son of King <hi>Henry,</hi> uſually called <hi>Sans-Terre, Without Land,</hi> to whom it ſeems the King, to take off that ignominious Name, had given his Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould alſo take up the Croſs. <hi>Henry,</hi> on the contrary, perſiſted obſtinately in his Proteſtations, that he would never ſuffer this Marriage, although he ſaid he would give his Conſent, or at leaſt, made that Pretence, that the Princeſs ſhould marry <hi>John,</hi> the youngeſt Brother of <hi>Richard;</hi> knowing well that that fierce and haughty Prince would never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer tamely that Indignity to be put upon him. Whereupon <hi>Philip</hi> ſeeing there was nothing further to be expected from that Conference, broke it up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he would do himſelf Juſtice by his Arms, ſince he was refuſed it by Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal <hi>d' Anaigne,</hi> without conſidering that the Injury proceeded from him, who obſtinately refuſed to accompliſh a Treaty ſo ſolemnly ſworn; whereas he ought to have preſſed the King of <hi>England</hi> to keep his Promiſe, and

That</hi> Rome <hi>never had any Right to make any Judgment againſt the Realm of</hi> France, <hi>whether the King ſhould take up Arms or not, either to oblige his Enemies to do him Reaſon, or to chaſtiſe his Rebellious Subjects. And for any thing more, the Sentence ſeemed to be the Product of</hi> Engliſh Sterling, <hi>and not to proceed from a diſ-intereſſed Legate; whoſe Duty was to perform the Office of a common Father, in the place of the Pope, whom he was ſent to repreſent.</hi> This was to ſpeak like a great King, who, without Emotion, knew how to maintain the Rights of his Crown independent from any other but God alone; and to preſerve his Soveraign Authority, without ſhocking that of the Church, whoſe Kingdom is wholly ſpiritual, and which it holds from Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore, as he hath aſſured us, is not of this World. But Prince <hi>Richard,</hi> who though he had ſeen as many Years as <hi>Philip,</hi> was not by far ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; nor ſo much Maſter of his Paſſion, as to be able to contain himſelf in ſuch reaſonable Terms: For finding himſelf particularly intereſſed in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of the Legate, which wholly ruined all his Pretenſions, he was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that running furiouſly upon him with his Sword in his Hand, without conſidering where he was, or what he was about to do, he had undoubtedly run him through, if the Archbiſhops and Lords, who aſſiſted at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, had not all together ruſhed upon this violent Prince, to ſtop his Fury, and thereby given opportunity to the Legate, half dead with Fear, to ſecure himſelf by Flight from the greateſt Danger that ever he had run in all his Life.</p>
                  <p>The Preliminary Diſcourſe of the Peace being thus broken, <hi>Philip,</hi> who was powerfully armed, purſued his Point ſo vigorouſly, that he took <hi>Ferte-Benard, Montfort, Beaumont,</hi> and ſome other places; and afterwards attacked, and by Force carried <hi>Mans,</hi> from whence <hi>Henry,</hi> who was retired thither, did, not without great difficulty, eſcape to <hi>Chinon,</hi> after having loſt the greateſt part of his Men in that Retreat, which was little better than a Flight. His Son <hi>John</hi> alſo, whom, among all his Children, he loved the moſt tenderly, abandoned him, to joyn with <hi>Philip,</hi> who, at the Head of his Army, paſſing the firſt over a Ford upon the <hi>Loir,</hi> took <hi>Tours</hi> by Aſſault. After which, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being in fear of his own Perſon, and having no aſſured place of Retreat, was forced to ſubmit to the Law of the Vanquiſher, and accept ſuch a Peace as he would pleaſe to give him; which was upon theſe following Conditions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>ſhould pay to</hi> Philip <hi>twenty thouſand Marks in Silver, for the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the War. That he ſhould put the Princeſs</hi> Alice <hi>into the Hands of ſuch as ſhould be appointed by the King and Prince</hi> Richard, <hi>who was to marry her after his Return from the</hi> Holy Land. <hi>That the two Kings and Prince</hi> Richard <hi>ſhould Rendeſvouz in the</hi> Mid-lent <hi>of the Year following at</hi> Vezelay, <hi>to begin together the Voyage which they were obliged to by their Vow. That the Vaſſals of the King of</hi> England <hi>ſhould take an Oath of Fealty to</hi> Richard; <hi>and that thoſe of them who had followed him in this War, ſhould not be obliged to render their Homage to</hi> Henry, <hi>till ſuch time as they were to go this Voyage to the</hi> Holy Land. <hi>That the Great Men of</hi> England <hi>ſhould promiſe to abandon the King, in caſe he ſhould fail in the performance of any one of theſe Articles; and that in the Interim,</hi> Philip <hi>and</hi> Richard <hi>ſhould hold certain Towns in Hoſtage, till ſuch time as he ſhould fully and truly have performed what was comprehended in the Treaty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported, that as the two Kings were in a Treaty in the open Field, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>June,</hi> between <hi>Tours</hi> and <hi>Chinon,</hi> concerning the Articles of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64918:89"/>this Peace,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> which ſeemed very inſupportable to <hi>Henry,</hi> there happened, two days ſucceſſively, two moſt terrible Claps of Thunder, although the Heavens were ſo ſerene, that there was not the leaſt ſpeck of a Cloud to be ſeen in the Sky; at which <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo dreadfully amazed, that if ſome of his Followers had not inſtantly run to him, to ſupport him, he had fallen from his Horſe: and that being thereupon ſtruck with mortal Apprehenſions of ſome terrible Puniſhment from Heaven, if he perſiſted longer to retard the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Peace, he accorded to <hi>Philip</hi> whatſoever he demanded, and immediately ſigned the Treaty. He had, nevertheleſs, a few Moments after, ſo many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Aſſaults of Shame and Grief upon his Soul, and was, in particular, ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touched with the undutiful Actions of his own Children, who had, from being one of the greateſt and moſt glorious Princes in the Univerſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him into that piteous Eſtate, to comply ſo meanly and tamely to what was impoſed upon him, that he preſently fell deſperately ſick, and in three days time dyed, in the ſixty firſt Year of his Age, upon the Octave of the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at the Caſtle of <hi>Chinon,</hi> beſtowing his Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions upon his diſobedient Sons, which he would never be perſuaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, notwithſtanding the repeated Inſtances which were made to him by the Biſhops who waited on him in his Sickneſs. He did, however, receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and Extream Unction, with great Devotion; giving manifeſt Tokens of his Repentance, in ſubmitting to the Divine Juſtice, which he acknowledged, had juſtly laid this great Change of Fortune upon him, as a Puniſhment for thoſe Crimes which he had committed in his Proſperity. He had alſo the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that his Domeſticks, every one ſeizing upon ſomething, left him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing elſe but a poor Sheet to cover him. But his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who had ſo furiouſly oppoſed him in his Life, gave all the Teſtimonies of an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Sorrow for his Death, and cauſed him to be carried, moſt magnificently adorned in his Royal Robes, to be interred at the Nunnery of <hi>Fontevraud,</hi> where he had a deſire to be buried. This new King himſelf aſſiſted at the Funerals, where he teſtified, by the abundance of his Tears, that he was unfeignedly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with Sorrow and Remorſe for his Father's Death. But it is reported that, to his other Grief, he had the Diſpleaſure to be afflicted with an odd and unaccountable Accident; for, as he approached the Corps of the deceaſed King, as he lay in the Coffin, the Blood which guſhed out of his Noſtrils ſeemed to reproach him with his Ingratitude, and unnatural Rebellion, and even, as the Diſcourſe went, the Parricide of his Father; whom his Diſobedience did, in ſome meaſure, ſeem to have haſtned to his Tomb ſooner than Nature, which was yet ſtrong and vigorous in him, had intended. He, nevertheleſs, ſtayed out the whole Ceremony, till ſuch time as the Royal Defunct was interred in the Quire of the Church of thoſe Religious Nuns; which verified the Revelation of a Monk, who praying, upon a certain time, for the Proſperity of the King, heard theſe words, which he then did not underſtand, but which were explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Event; <hi>He ſhall take up my Sign, and in carrying it, ſhall be mightily tormented: The Belly of his Wife ſhall riſe up againſt him; and at the laſt, he ſhall be hid among the Veils.</hi> For, as he took the Croſs for the Holy War, he carried the Sign of Jeſus Chriſt; and he was immediately after cruelly tormented by the Perſecutions of his Sons, which continued till his Death; after which, he was covered with the Veil of Death, being interred in a Quire of Veiled Nuns.</p>
                  <p>We muſt however, do Juſtice to the Memory of this Prince, who was one in this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> though it ſo happened, that he never had his part in any Action, in regard it was ſo long deferred by the War, whereof he was the Occaſion. He was a <hi>French</hi> Man by Nation, born in the City of <hi>Mans,</hi> which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed to call his Darling: and moſt aſſuredly, he was one of the greateſt, and moſt potent Kings that ever ſat upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne; and certainly, had been the moſt fortunate, if either he had never been a Father, or if, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end of his thirty and five Years Reign, he had not met with the Oppoſition of the young and invincible <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, whoſe Fortune, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by his Courage and admirable Prudence, was as a fatal Curb, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prediction of the famous <hi>Morling,</hi> was to tame this fierce and haughty Leopard; or like a ſtrong Dam, which ſtopped ſhort, and broke that

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> which menaced an Inundation over the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> whereof <hi>Henry</hi> already poſſeſſed a very great part: For, beſides <hi>England,</hi> where he reigned as Soveraign Monarch; and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he had conquered; <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was Tributary to him; he alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>Normandy</hi> in the Right of Inheritance, deſcending to him by his Mother <hi>Maud,</hi> the Empreſs, Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> I. King of <hi>England;</hi> and by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> his Father, who was Son to Count <hi>Fowk;</hi> he had <hi>Anjou, Maine, Touraine,</hi> a great part of <hi>Berry</hi> and <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he pretended to be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: And, in Right of Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> his Wife, whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, by a Canonical Sentence, he had <hi>Gaſcon, Guienne, Poitou,</hi> and the other Countries which depended upon them: Beſides that, <hi>Britanny</hi> fell to his third Son <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> by the Marriage of the Heireſs of that Country. So that he was as potent on this Side the Sea, where he was a Homager to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> as he was on the other ſide, where he was King of <hi>England,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He was of a middle Stature, but of a Shape no way handſom, by reaſon that he was extream groſs and corpulent, notwithſtanding that he was, not only very temperate, but amidſt the great Affairs in which he was always employed, and which he managed with wonderful Application, in continual Action; either travelling, or Walking, or making uſe of the more violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Riding the great Horſe, or Hunting; that thereby he might abate the growing unwieldy by his Fatneſs, to which his Sanguin Complexion had condemned him. As for any thing elſe, he was of Temperament, robuſt and ſound; having a large, full Breaſt, and a big Head: His Eyes were blew, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and full of Fire: His Hair yellow and ſoft, inclining ſomething too much towards the red: His Voice hoarſe, his Speech rough, and his Mind very fierce and Martial. For his Mind, he was very dexterous, and of a penetrating Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but ſomething more crafty than became ſo great a Prince: He had, however, cultivated his Spirit with the Study of Ingenuous Learning, which inabled him with a certain Eloquence, very eaſily and naturally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf. And there was in his Soul ſuch a Stock of Vices, as well as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, natural Perfections and Imperfections; which were ſo blended together, that if they would not permit it to be ſaid of him, that he was a very exceeding good Prince, yet they very abſolutely prohibit the fixing the Character of a very ill one upon him: For he was gentle and ſweet to every body, when he was in dangers; but harſh, fierce and ſevere when he ſaw himſelf out of them: he was complaiſant abroad, moroſe to his Domeſticks; liberal to Strangers, and in publick, but parſimonious to his own, and too great a Husband in his private Affairs: A great Promiſer, but a ſlender Performer; above all things, loving his Liberty, and hating Conſtraint, to that degree, that he could not endure to be a Slave to his own Word, or his Faith, which he made no great ſcruple, upon occaſion, to violate. In matters of Juſtice, he was too ſlow; and ſometimes, by the Interpoſition of Money, which he loved exceſſively, he would wholly remit the Execution of it. He drew great Sums from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, with which he often choſe rather to buy Peace, than maintain War, in which he did not delight; though when he was forced to make War, he did it like a great Captain, and an expert Soldier; ſhewing more Tenderneſs and Goodneſs towards his Soldiers, when he underſtood they were ſlain, and in lamenting their Deaths, than he uſed to ſhew to them whilſt they were living: He was wonderful kind to the Church-men, and above all, to the Biſhops, whom he always loved to have about him; but yet not concerning himſelf much with their Franchiſes and Privileges, to which he had but very little regard: He was a paſſionate Lover of his Children, but he was ever raiſing Differences among them, one with another, to prevent their falling into Quarrels with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but this proved an unlucky Project to him, and at laſt was the occaſion that they all joyned together againſt him. He was magnanimous and generous in his Enterpriſes; but withal, ſo haughtily ambitious, that he was uſed to ſay, that the whole Earth was not ſufficient to ſatiate the Deſires of a King like him: He was equally conſtant in his Love and Hate, which he did not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily change; a great Patron of Widows, Orphans, of poor diſtreſſed People who were without Support, of whom he took great care; above all, he was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64918:90"/>kind to ſuch as had the Misfortune to be Shipwrack'd upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> aboliſhing that barbarous Cuſtom which had long prevailed, of deſpoiling ſuch miſcrable Perſons of all that which they had ſaved from the Sea, except their Lives, which the Country People were uſed to call, God's Goods: He was a great Lover of the publick Peace and Tranquility, which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Dominion, by the rigorous Juſtice which he cauſed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to ſuch notorious Malefactors as were found Diſturbers of them; ſo that he cleared his Eſtates of Thieves, Robbers and Murderers: He was pious, and fearing God; but very ſhy and reſerved to the Church-men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the publick Penance which he did for the Death of <hi>Becket.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all theſe Vertues, which cannot, without Injuſtice, be ſuppreſſed, were diſhonoured by his great Vices; and principally, by his Impudicity and Avarice; which prevailed ſo upon him, that, beſides the Exactions, which were very great, which he impoſed upon his People, he ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Jews; diſſembling his Knowledge of their Inſolencies againſt the Chriſtians, becauſe of the great Gain which theſe faithleſs Uſurers made, whereof he had a Share. He would alſo ſuffer long Vacancies in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, to the end he might enjoy their Revenues; giving a very ſlender Reaſon in Excuſe; That it was much better for him to employ that Money for the Service of the Realm, than that it ſhould be ſpent in the Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of proud and pompous Trains, Pleaſures and Delicacies, as the Biſhops waſted it, after the manner of the wicked World, and in a way far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Temperance and Vertue of their Predeceſſors of the ancient Church. But in talking at this rate, he condemned himſelf, excuſing one fault by committing another, far greater than that which he reproached; for he uſually beſtowed the Revenues upon ſuch a ſort of People as, by the notorious ſcandalous way of their living, even in his own Judgment, rendred themſelves unworthy of them: Whereas he ought rather to have taken care that thoſe great Revenues ſhould have been expended according to the Rules of the Church, by the Nomination of good Subjects, and worthy Men, to thoſe high and great Preferments: And indeed, he did, in a great meaſure, towards the end of his Life and Reign, make a Reparation for this Errour; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him much Trouble, and raiſed many uneaſie Scruples in his Soul; for he nominated to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury, Baldwin,</hi> a <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Monk, a moſt excellent Man; and to the See of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he preferred St. <hi>Hugh,</hi> the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> the Perſon, of all the Prelates of his time, who took the holy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to repreſent their Failings to the Kings, his Contemporaries, by that marvellous Authority which, by the Sanctity of his Life, he had ſo deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired. In ſhort, The great Medly of Vertues and of Vices in this King, were alſo accompanied with that of his good and evil Fortune; but with this remarkable difference; that his happy State laſted thirty Years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he flouriſhed in all Earthly Glory and Felicity; whereas he was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ill Deſtiny, but for the laſt five Years of his Life; and that too was occaſioned by his invincible Wilfulneſs, in refuſing Peace upon ſuch juſt and honourable Conditions as were tendred: Whereby he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf that War, which, for two Years, retarded the Effect of the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> ſo that it was begun by the <hi>Germans</hi> alone, with abundance of Zeal and Courage.</p>
                  <p>For preſently after the Conference in the Field of <hi>Giſors,</hi> where the two Kings took upon them the Croſs, <hi>Henry</hi> Cardinal <hi>d' Albano,</hi> the Pope's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> paſſed into <hi>Germany,</hi> to perſuade the Emperor to undertake the Holy War. The Emperor then reigning, was the famous <hi>Frederick,</hi> the firſt of that Name, formerly Duke of <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia;</hi> who after having ſo gloriouſly aſſiſted his Uncle <hi>Conrade,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Cruſade,</hi> ſucceeded him in the Imperial Throne, which he poſſeſſed for ſix and thirty Years, with much Glory and Proſperity; leaving throughout all <hi>Germany, Poland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the illuſtrious Marks of the greatneſs of his Courage, his Mind, his Vertues, and his admirable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And were it poſſible to obliterate the deadly Remembrance of the Schiſm, which, by an unhappy Engagement, he made in the Church,

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> it might with great Juſtice be affirmed that his Reign ought to be eſteemed as the greateſt of any Prince that ever the Empire had, ſince the Death of the celebrated <hi>Charlemain.</hi> He was then about ſixty and eight Years of Age, of a Port extremely Majeſtick, a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſomewhat ſurpaſſing the middle, but of a Proportion in all the Parts of his Body, regular and Exact; and from which his Age which did him no other Injury but to render him Venerable, had not taken much of that natural Force, which he had in ſo great a Meaſure, and which was accompanied with an admirable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility in all manner of Exerciſes: The turn of his Face was very fine, and the Lines delicate conſidering his Age; his Cheeks were plump, his Eye-brows large, his Eyes very ſweet, and yet lively and piercing, his Speech agreeable, his Mouth ſmiling, and his Air ſo engaging that to whomſoever he did the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but once to ſpeak, they found it impoſſible to defend themſelves from his Charmes; and he always left the Image of Majeſty ſo deeply imprinted and graven in their Memories, that it was impoſſible to efface it from the Mind, or to prevent its being continually preſent to their Remembrance; his Hair by reaſon of the Change which ſo many Years had brought upon it, was perfect white, which ſtill ſeemed to add ſomething more Venerable to his Majeſty, though the Natural Colour of it had been red, from whence he came to acquire the Name of <hi>Barbarouſſe,</hi> or <hi>Red beard,</hi> a Name which his fair and glorious Actions, have rendred as famous among Hiſtorians, as thoſe others more beautiful, which have been given to the moſt renowned Princes to diſtinguiſh them by a particular Appellation and as an Elogy for their Vertues and Atchievements. As for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Soul, they yet far ſurpaſſed thoſe of his Body; for he had a moſt Beautiful Mind, a moſt happy Memory, which being joyned with the long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and the Care he had taken to inſtruct himſelf in all things, had made him acquire an infinite Number of ſuch pretty Sorts of Learning and Knowledge, as might well rank him in the Catalogue of the moſt able men of his Time. He was extreme Wife and Judicious, Liberal and of great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Affable and Courteous to all men, condeſcending even to the meaneſt of his Subjects; but terrible to his Enemies, and above all to Rebels, a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, perſonally Valiant and fearleſs in the greateſt Dangers, always carrying himſelf with mighty Evenneſs, and Temper in both the one and the other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, though it was his Happineſs not to be much acquainted with the Worſe.</p>
                  <p>Being ſuch as I have now deſcribed him, and therefore equally feared, loved and reſpected by all the Princes of the Empire, he had called a General Diet at <hi>Mayence</hi> to meet the Fourth Sunday in Lont, in the Year 1188. there the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates came in Perſon, where after they had happily compoſed all the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which remained between ſeveral Princes and Cities of the Empire, they made the ſame Remonſtrances for relieving the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> which they had before made to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England. Frederick</hi> who for above ten years had fully reconciled himſelf with the Church, had before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that generous Reſolution, for his own Satisfaction, to employ thoſe Arms for Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> which by the Misfortunes of the Times, he had made uſe of againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He nevertheleſs demanded the Advice of the Aſſembly thereupon, but in ſuch a manner as made it eaſily be known, what was in the Intention of his Soul; for he only propoſed whether it was to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not whether he ſhould refuſe that Aſſiſtance which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf demanded of him, which was ſuch a cowardly and ſhameful Ingratitude, which he knew the whole Aſſembly would diſdain, but whether he ſhould defer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the Croſs, after that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> had with much Ardour em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it. Whereupon all the Princes and the Prelates, and all the Deputies of the Cities, cried out with one Voice, as if the Emperor had at the ſame inſtant inſpired them all, with his one Zeal and Courage, <hi>That without deferring any longer, they ought to take up the Croſs, that all the World might ſee that the</hi> German <hi>Nation, eſpecially under ſuch an Emperor, would never yield, either in their Zeal, or in their Courage to the</hi> Engliſh, French, <hi>or any Nation under Heaven.</hi> So that now there was nothing more to be done but to conclude the Holy War and the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade.</hi> The Emperor at the ſame inſtant deſcending from his Throne to receive
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64918:91"/>the Croſs by the Hands of the Legates,
<label type="milestone">

The greateſt part of thoſe who were preſent at that Aſſembly following that illuſtrious Example al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo took upon them the Croſs with an incredible Ardour. The Principal of which were <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria, Berthodus</hi> Duke of <hi>Moravia, Herman</hi> Marquis of <hi>Baden,</hi> the Counts <hi>de Naſſau, de Thuringe, de Miſſen, de Hollandia,</hi> and more than ſixty others of the moſt eniment Princes of the Empire; the Biſhops of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanſon, Cambray, Munſter, Osnabrug, Miſſen, Paſſau, Wirzbourg</hi> and more then ten beſides, all which beſides the Legates, went immediately to preach the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> in their ſeveral Dioceſſes, and throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> where an infinite Number of People of all Conditions took up the Croſs. But the Emperor, who knew by the Experience of the Second <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that two great a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude occaſioned nothing but Cumber, Trouble and famine in an Army, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cauſed an Edict to be publiſhed by which he prohibited, all thoſe who were not able to expend three marks in Silver to provide themſelves of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for ſo long a Voyage, to engage in it or liſt themſelves for this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and alſo commanded thoſe of the greateſt Ability, to make the beſt Preparation for it that they were able, that ſo they might have wherewith to ſerve themſelves in their Neceſſities. After which he gave Command that all the <hi>Cruſades</hi> ſhould repair to their Colours at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> the Year inſuing, where he promiſed without fail to be himſelf upon the Feaſt of St. <hi>George,</hi> and that he would then immediately advance without ſtaying for the reſt.</p>
                  <p>This being done he ſent four ſeveral Ambaſſadours to ſo many Princes with whom he muſt neceſſarily treat, before he undertook any thing further. <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Diets</hi> was ſent to <hi>Saladin,</hi> to ſummon them to reſtore the Holy Land which he had uſurped from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as alſo the Wood of the Holy Croſs which he had taken at the Battle of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and in Caſe of his refuſal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce War againſt him from the Emperor. I do not here pretend to inſert the Letters of theſe two great Princes, which paſs for Currant with many Hiſtorians, in regard that it appears clearly that they are Counterfiets, and the Forgeries of ſome Prolifick Scribe, who had more deſire to pleaſe, than Art in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling of them, ſo as to render them either probable or Pleaſant. <hi>Godfrey</hi> Baron of <hi>Wiſenbach</hi> was diſpatched to the Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> who pretended to be a Wonderful Friend to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and who made many ſtrong Proteſtations, that he and all his ſhould ever be at the Emperors Service, who might at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure paſs through his Eſtates with the ſame Freedom as if they were his own. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> alſo himſelf at the ſame time writ to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſent to deſire Paſſage through his Territories, and that he might be furniſhed with Proviſions at the Price Currant. To this he agreed but after a very inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent manner, detaining the Ambaſſadour without any poſitive Reſolution, till thoſe of the Sultan of <hi>Iconium</hi> paſſed by <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> there to make the Offers and Complements of their Maſter to the Emperor. The Arch Biſhop of <hi>Mayence</hi> was the only man of that Character, who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt advantageouſly in his Negotiation, for he obtained of <hi>Bela</hi> King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> all that he deſired, which was the Princeſs his Daughter for <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia</hi> Son to the Emperor, and Security of Paſſage and Proviſion for the Army at moſt reaſonable Rates. Thus all things being diſpoſed to begin this great Enterpriſe, <hi>Frederick,</hi> who had paſſed all the Lent and the Feſtivals of Eaſter at <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> to attend the coming of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> parted from thence the latter End of <hi>April</hi> with thoſe who were already come, and deſcended down the <hi>Danubius,</hi> as far as <hi>Presbourg,</hi> whereupon Whitſunday he held a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of all the Princes, Prelates, and high Officers of his Army, to regulate their March, and to eſtabliſh that good Order and thoſe wholeſome Laws againſt all Crimes, and Licentiouſneſs, which were ſo neceſſary in an Army, and which he was reſolved ſhould be moſt exactly obeyed, as they were afterwards during the whole Voyage. In Concluſion after having cauſed <hi>Henry</hi> his eldeſt Son to be crowned King, of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he took his March at the Head of a fair and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64918:91"/>Army,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> conſiſting in more then one hundred and fifty thouſand Soldiers all choiſe men, with which he croſſed all <hi>Hungary</hi> with King <hi>Bela,</hi> who came to receive him upon the Frontier, conducted him as far as <hi>Belgrade;</hi> from whence after a Repoſe of eight days he entred into <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> which he was two Months in paſſing, by reaſon that he was forced ſo often to combat with thoſe Barbarous People, who laid continual Ambuſhes in his Paſſage, and whom he could defeat no other ways but by guarding the Paſſage on both ſides of his Army, and as faſt as they could be taken hanging up theſe Thieves upon the next Trees where they were ſeized.</p>
                  <p>But he had ſomething more to doe when he entred upon the Territories of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, where believing he ſhould paſs as a Friend and meet with all manner of Refreſhments and Accomodations for his Army, as had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, he found nothing throughout, but Enemies Armed againſt him by the Perfidy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor: but it did not fail at laſt to fall heavy upon him as it had formerly upon the two <hi>Comnenius</hi>'s <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Manuel</hi> in the two firſt <hi>Cruſades.</hi> This Emperor was that <hi>Iſaacius Angelus,</hi> who about five Years before had been proclaimed Emperor in a Sedition, which himſelf had raiſed for the Deſtruction of the Cruel <hi>Andronicus.</hi> He was a man who had little either Soul or Heart, but the Want of thoſe was ſupplied with Preſumption and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in abundance, by which he made all his Follies and thoſe Vices moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which are moſt capable of rendring a Prince deſpicable and hated; for he was ſottiſh even to downright folly, extreme light and inconſtant, coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Voluptuous, Effeminate, moſt fooliſhly Prodigal, and infamouſly Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; taking a Pleaſure to receive from all ſorts of Perſons, though it were but Toys add Triſles, and making no Difficulty to take any thing that pleaſed his Fancy, even to the horrible Sacriledge of robbing the Churches, without any Scruple, of their Jewels, Plate and Ornaments, and even the Conſecrated Veſſels, to make uſe of at his Publick Entertainments, notwithſtanding that he ſeemed even to a ſtrange Bigottry to make Profeſſion of Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin, to whom he made moſt Magnificent Offerings and honoured her with Images conſecrated to her, the richeſt in the World, all gliſtering with Gold, and ſparkling with the faireſt Stones that could be procured. As for any thing more, he was aman without Truth, Faith and Honour, who delighted in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Injoyment of his Riches, and the Sweets of Empire, which he ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly promiſed himſelf he ſhould enjoy more than Thirty Years; and in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim abandoning all the Care and Trouble of it to ſome one of his Favourites, which was ſometimes a doating old <hi>Eunuch,</hi> otherwhiles ſome young fantaſtical Boy, ſcarcely paſt the Diſcipline of a School or got free from the Ferula, who now muſt manage a Sceptre, and by whom he permitted himſelf to be lead as if he had been a meer Child. See what ſort of man this Emperor <hi>Iſaacius</hi> was, who after he had promiſed to <hi>Frederick</hi> not only all ſafe Paſſage, but all manner of Aſſiſtance, did all that lay in the Compaſs of his Power againſt him, and that for theſe two more eſpecial reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for that <hi>Saladin,</hi> who knew well how to amuſe him had made him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Vain Promiſes to beſtow <hi>Paleſtine</hi> upon him; upon Condition that he ſhould obſtruct the Paſſage of the Occidentals; That he ſhould enter into an alliance with him, and thereby oblige himſelf to ſend his Gallies to his aſſiſtance and that his Ambaſſadors, which he had at the Court of <hi>Conſtaminople,</hi> ſhould be there treated with all manner of Honour. The Second Reaſon was, that he permitted himſelf moſt ſottiſhly to be ſeduced by the Impoſtures of a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cheat, the manner of which I am about to relate. There was a certain <hi>Venetian,</hi> who having got himſelf naturallized a <hi>Geeek</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Name of <hi>Doſitheos,</hi> and there turned Monk in the famous Monaſtery of <hi>Studius,</hi> from whence he hoped that he ſhould one day be able to Mount to the higheſt Dignities of the Church. Now whether this Fellow was really a great Maſter in the Art of Aſtrology and taking the true Horeſcope or that he was really acquainted with that which is more Criminal and the black Art, or which I think was the moſt eaſie, that he boldly played the Prophet at all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in regard he had nothing to looſe but his little Credit, if his Prophecies ſhould not prove true, certain it is that he predicted to <hi>Iſaacius</hi> a long time before it happened, that he ſhould one day attain the Empire. That Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64918:92"/>had made ſuch an Impreſſion upon his mind,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> and had gained ſo much Belief and Conſideration with him that he believed it as an Oracle; and happening luckily to fall out accordingly, there was nothing which he thought too much to do for <hi>Doſithcos.</hi> So that ſome little time after having made two Patriarchs of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> be ſucceſſively depoſed under falſe Pretexts, he having therefore elevated them to that Dignity, he took a great Phancy to transferr his <hi>Doſitheos</hi> from the Chair of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof he poſſeſſed only the Titular Right as being one of the Imperial Cities. But he found a great Obſtacle to the Accompliſhment of his Deſire, in Regard that in the Code of the Oriential Church, there were found certain Canons of more than one Ages ſtanding which prohibited theſe kind of Tranſlations particularly of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and much more of one Partiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate to another: To ſurmount this Difficulty, he had recourſe to a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Artifice, which was apparently ſuggeſted to him by this falſe <hi>Doſitheos,</hi> and which ſucceeded according to his Wiſh. There was in his Court the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Theodore Balſamon,</hi> who of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> was eſteemed the moſt able and skilful Canoniſt, and who hath left us a Digeſt of the Canons of little Fidelity, more then to inable the Adverſaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, of which he declared himſelf upon all Occaſions the Implacable Enemy, from thence to draw Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Eternal Oppoſition. This man was Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he yet retained not the leaſt Authority, in regard that City was wholly in the Power of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who had there a Patriarch of their own. I would by no means indure the Goverment of a Schiſmatick. Now the Emperor who knew his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Humour, and that he was capable of doing and ſaying what he pleaſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he were ſatisfied in that governing Paſſion, cauſed him one day to be ſent for in Private, where making to him a pretended Confidence he complained to him miſerably of the ſmall Number of able men that were to be found among the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and in the Monaſteries from whence he ſaid Learning and Vertue ſeemed in a manner to be baniſhed; inſomuch that in all his Empire he could find but one man, who was capable of filling the Vacant Seat of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> So as he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do Honour to the Church and to be able to oppoſe the <hi>Latins.</hi> After which he ſaid, as it were opening his very Heart to him, that not knowing any Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf capable by reaſon of his merit, to ſuſtain that great Dignity, he had along time had it in his Thoughts to tranſlate him from the Patriarchate of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> of which he poſſeſſed only the empty Title, to that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where he might have the Opportunity of diſplaying more advantageouſly thoſe Great Talents which God had imparted to him, and particularly, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Skill which he had acquired in the Laws and the Diſcipline of the Church: But that hitherto he never durſt enterprize it, in regard that he had always heard it ſaid, that ſuch Tranſlations were not lawful or according to the Canons; but notwithſtanding if he who was far more knowing than any other, and who was reputed the very Oracle of thoſe kinds of Learning, was able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and perſwade the World by interpreting the Canons, that they might very well according to the Intention of the Church upon certain Occaſions be ſuſpended, as ſometimes they had been, it would be the greateſt joy and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the World to him, and that without deferring a Moment longer, he would name him to the Chair of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> There needed no more to make <hi>Theodore</hi> yield, after the Temptation of poſſeſſing of ſuch an elevated Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which that ambitious man ſuffered to overcome him without making the leaſt Reſiſtance againſt it. He therefore readily anſwered the Emperor, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould not fail to receive full ſatisfaction, and that it was eaſie to acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Canons to his advantage. See now the deplorable Weakneſs of the greateſt part of Mankind; who, whereas they ought to regulate their Paſſions, by ſubmitting them to the Laws, chuſe rather on the contrary to rule the Law by accomodating it to their Paſſions, whileſt they endeavour by their falſe Subtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to perſwade themſelves, that it is not at all contrary to what they deſir.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor having thus artificially drawn him into the Snare, the next day aſſembled all the Biſhops who were in great Numbers about the Court, to the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> where it was in his Preſence propoſed, whether this kind of Tranſlation, might be allowed according to the Canons. <hi>Balſamon,</hi> who had not been wanting the preceding Night to inſtruct his Brethren, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many famous Inſtances out of Antiquity, that the Ancient Canons did not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64918:92"/>abſolutely prohibit it,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> but that they only were deſigned to reform the Abuſe which might be made of it. All his <hi>Partiſans</hi> whom, he had gained to his Opinion, and the others who were nothing ſo knowing as himſelf, eſpecially in the Canon Law, were immediately in the ſame Sentiment. Thus it paſſed without Difficulty as their Opinion and the Tranſlation which might really be made for the greater advantage of the Church, was alſo authorized and comfirmed as Lawful by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Letters. After which the Emperor who had now all that he deſired, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Doſitheos</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and having thus gulled poor <hi>Theodore,</hi> left him as he found him, to ſtarve upon his lean Honour of being ſtill the Titular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Antioch.</hi> However <hi>Doſitheos,</hi> who made his Entry into <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with all the Pomp and magnificence of a Triumph, did not long rejoyce in the Enjoyment of his wretched Cheat; for the Biſhops unable to ſuffer that he had thus abuſed them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> entred into ſo many Cabals againſt him, and ſo wrought up the Hatred of the Populace, to whom he was already odious by the manner of his Living which was altogether unworthy of that high Dignity, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who would have ſupported him by Force, fearing it might occaſion a great Sedition, was at length conſtrained to abandon him, and to ſuffer him to be depoſed, about two Years after he had by Fraud obtained it, <hi>Georgius Xiphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> ſucceeding in his Place; ſo that he not only loſt the Chair of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to which he had unlawfully aſpired, but that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo, which upon his Tranſlation was conferred upon another.</p>
                  <p>But in that time that he was Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he abſolutely gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Emperor, and by his Deluſions turned him which way he pleaſed; then it was that he made him believe, that the Deſign of <hi>Frederick</hi> was not with that powerful Army to make War againſt <hi>Saladin</hi> for the Deliverance of the Holy Land, and the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but a pure Artifice to cover the Deſign which he had to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And to confirm this, counterfeiting the Prophet, he ſhewed him certain fantaſtical Figures, which he ſaid had been drawn by <hi>Salomon,</hi> to repreſent the future State of things; from which he aſſured that fooliſh and Credulous Emperor that <hi>Frederick</hi> was to enter <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the Gate <hi>Xylocernos,</hi> which joyned to the Palace of <hi>Blaquernes;</hi> that he ſhould commit a thouſand abominably things, but that in the end he ſhould be moſt ſeverely puniſhed. All theſe Fooleries he pronounced with an Air ſo affirmative and ſo ſerious, that this ridiculous Prince, to prevent the Effects of his Predictions, cauſed the Port of <hi>Blaquernes</hi> to be walled up; then <hi>Doſitheos,</hi> ſhewing him the Windows of the Higheſt Tower of the five which beautiſie that fair Palace, would needs carry him up thither, where with two Darts, which he uſually carried in his left Hand, he was to ſtand huffing and in a menacing Poſture, which the filly Conjurer told him, ſhould ſtrike <hi>Frederick</hi> with his <hi>Germans</hi> to the Hearts, ſo that he ſhould not need to trouble himſelf to march out to give them Battle: Thus did he expoſe him as if he had been all pure Fool, to the Deriſion of all that ſaw or heard of this ſilly Adventure.</p>
                  <p>However he did not fail amidſt all his Stupid Vanity, to give out the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Orders, for obſtructing the Paſſage of the Emperor, to whom at the ſame time he offered the moſt inſupportable Affront; For as <hi>Frederick</hi> approached the Frontier, he ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> Robert Earl of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and Count <hi>Walram</hi> in Ambaſſage to him, to deſire that he might have free Paſſage, and Proviſions for the Army, according to the Stipulations of the Treaty; this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, after he had at firſt received them in a tollerable good manner, within eight days, threw them loaden with Irons into a dark and loathſome Priſon, thereby in a manner wholly Barbarous, violating the very Law of Nations, to oblige the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Saladin,</hi> who uſed their utmoſt Efforts to engage him ſo deeply in a War with <hi>Frederick,</hi> that he might not know how to go back from his Promiſes to their Maſter. Then following the Advice of his <hi>Doſitheos,</hi> who was of Confederacy with the <hi>Saraſins;</hi> he armed powerfully, and ſent his Couſin <hi>Manuel,</hi> the Great Maſter of the Horſe, with a numerous Army, and Orders to diſpute the Paſſes with the <hi>Germans;</hi> and to cut off all Proviſions from them, But the Cowardiſe of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was but a feeble Obſtacle to the Invincible Forces of <hi>Frederick;</hi> for not being able ſo much as to indure the ſight of the Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> who with his Sword in his Hand, marched againſt them at the Head of the Vanguard, they immediately turned their Backs and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64918:93"/>abandoned the Barricades and Retrenchments which they had made at the firſt Paſs of the Mountains,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> which lead into <hi>Thracia:</hi> So that all the Army falling into that Country, the Emperor to puniſh the Treachery of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to live at Diſcretion, as they did, finding in the Fields great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all kinds of Grain, it being now <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks,</hi> had not time to carry into the fenced Towns and Cities according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which had been given.</p>
                  <p>But that which finiſhed his Ruin, was the inſupportable Vanity of <hi>Iſaacius,</hi> who ſending to treat with <hi>Frederick,</hi> did it in the moſt brutiſh manner in the World denying him the Title of Emperor; for he ſent to him to let him underſtand, <hi>That he knew no other Emperor but of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>which was himſelf; and that if he would acknowledge him in that Quality for his Lord and Maſter, and give him ſo many Hoſtages as he demanded, for Security that he would Enterprize nothing contrary to his Service or Intereſts, and give him the Moiety of all the Conqueſts which he ſhould make upon the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>then, and upon no other Terms he was reſolved to afford him the Liberty of the Paſſage which he deſired.</hi> Now whether the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor was ſo indiſcreet to command in this kind of Inſolent Language, which ſeems agreeable enough to his Character and his Genius; or that the Envoys, as <hi>Nicetas</hi> in excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, would aſſure us, exceeded the Limits of their Commiſſion, is uncertain; But <hi>Frederick</hi> though he was not a little picqued, yet had the Diſcretion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal and ſmother his Reſentment, till he had procured the Liberty of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours: And therefore he contented himſelf with returning this Anſwer with a diſdainful Smile, which manifeſted a great meaſure of Aſſurance, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sharpneſs, <hi>That he truſted in God, and in all thoſe brave men which accompanied him, that there was yet no great Neceſſity for his complying with ſuch kind Terms; that for any thing more when their Maſter,</hi> ſpeaking to the Ambaſſadours, <hi>had reſtored to him his Ambaſſadours whom he held in Chains, with ſo much Inhumanity, and ſo much againſt the Law of all Nations, to the Shame of the Chriſtian Name which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he expoſed to the Deriſion of the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>he ſhould have a Subject whereupon in ſome ſort to acknowledge himſelf obliged to him, the Honour of God and the Empire ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> After with advancing daily without ſtaying for the Anſwer of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and ſeizing without Reſiſtance, upon all the Places in his Paſſage, upon the twentieth fifth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he incamped within View of <hi>Philioppopolis,</hi> a great and rich City upon the <hi>Hebrus,</hi> ſcituate between three Hills at the Foot of Mount <hi>Hemus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hiſtorian <hi>Nicetas Acominatus,</hi> a perſon of Quality, and firſt Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Emperor, was then Governour of that Province, whereof this was the Capital City. Now as he received every Day ſeveral Orders, by the lightneſs and inſtability of his Maſters Mind, who to Day would command that all Hands ſhould be at work upon the Fortifications, and to Morrow, that they ſhould demoliſh them and quit the Town; he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could do the one or the other, ſurprized, in ſuch manner, as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, with the principal of the Inhabitants, to ſeek his Safety in quitting the City: There <hi>Frederick</hi> quartered his whole Army, to refreſh his Men with the prodigious Plenty of Proviſions which he found there; for the City was very Rich, by the Traffick which they had with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who were a great party of the Inhabitants, and who loved the <hi>Franks</hi> extremely. Four Days after this, <hi>Manuel,</hi> the General of the <hi>Greek</hi> Army, being perpetually ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the Emperor, who accuſed him of Cowardice, advanced within ſix Miles of <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> with expreſs Order to combat the <hi>Germans.</hi> But he was ſo little acquainted with War, that ſome of the Vancouriers of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were abroad to diſcover the Enemies Poſture, having taken ſome Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were ſtraggling, took a Reſolution to aſſault their whole Army, which they did with ſuch Courage, that thoſe cowardly <hi>Greeks</hi> believing that they had all <hi>Frederick</hi>'s in the Head of them, ſhamefully turned their Backs, leaving the Field intirely to thoſe few <hi>Germans:</hi> Nor did they after this find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that appeared like Body of an Army. After which, having taken ſome ſtrong Places which were defended by the <hi>Alains,</hi> whom <hi>Saladin</hi> had ſent to aid the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were all, for a Terror to the reſt, put to the Sword: So that ſeizing upon <hi>Nicopolis, Adrianople,</hi> and all the Cities which are between the

                     <hi>Egean</hi> and the <hi>Euxine</hi> Seas, they inlarged their Conqueſts on both ſides,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> to the very Gates of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then it was, that the perfidious <hi>Iſaacius,</hi> finding himſelf reduced to the laſt Extremities, ſet the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Frederick</hi> at Liberty, and in all ſuppliant and humble manner, deſired a Peace. He offered all the Shipping that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his Paſſage into <hi>Aſia,</hi> intreating that this Paſſage might be as quick as could be, and that he might have Hoſtages for his Security. But <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was reſolved to pull down the fooliſh Pride of this feeble, but preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, who before would not treat with him, but as King of the <hi>Germans,</hi> made him now very ſenſible that he was the Emperor of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he anſwered the Ambaſſadors, <hi>That it was the Right of the Conquerors to give Laws to the Vanquiſhed, That it appertained to him who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi> Thracia, <hi>to diſpoſe of it as he thought convenient. That therefore, the Year being ſo far advanced, he was reſolved to winter in</hi> Thracia <hi>with his whole Army, to puniſh their Master for having ſo long retarded his Voyage by his fooliſh Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and giving him the trouble to beat him, and to take his Towns, where he had now no longer any Right. But if he expected any Favour from him, that he muſt take Care againſt</hi> Eaſter, <hi>in the Year enſueing, to provide him ſo much Shipping as was neceſſary for the Tranſportation of his whole Army into</hi> Aſia, <hi>by the</hi> Helleſpont; <hi>and to give him ſufficient Security for his Promiſes, of which he knew he would be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but which he had no manner of Reaſon to repoſe any ſort of Confidence in; That he was reſolved to have in Hoſtage four and twenty of the principal Officers and Lords of his Court, and eight hundred others of inferior Quality, whom he muſt forthwith ſend to him, together with the Ambaſſadors of the Sultan of</hi> Iconium, <hi>whom he reſtrained at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>contrary to the Law of Nations. That upon theſe Conditions he would give him the Aſſurance of his Oath, that he had no deſigns upon his Empire, as he had vainly imagined, or at leaſt, made a ſhew of believing, that ſo he might have ſome Pretext, though a very ill one, for the violation of his Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is certainly nothing ſo Inſolent as a proud Coward in Proſperity, when he finds himſelf extraordinarily advanced by his good Fortune; nor is there any thing ſo Low, Mean, and Croaching, when once his Haughtineſs is tamed and brought down by the reverſe of Adverſity. This <hi>Iſaacius,</hi> who a little before boaſted with inſufferable Inſolence, that he was the only Emperor, and next to God, the Lord and Maſter of other Kings, now thought himſelf very happy to be offered a Treaty, which gave him liberty to accept even of theſe diſhonourable Conditions, which were ſufficiently humbling for him. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without Delay ſent the Ratification, with the Ambaſſadors, the Hoſtages, and great Preſents to the Emperor, who paſſed the Winter at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> till <hi>Eaſter</hi> approaching he went to <hi>Callipolis,</hi> where he was reſolved to paſs the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> There he did not fail to find far more Shipping than <hi>Iſaacius</hi> had promiſed him, for there were of Barkes, Brigantines, Galliots, and Gallies, near upon five hundred; ſo much haſt did that poor Prince make to deliver himſelf from theſe dangerous and troubleſome Gueſts, who had perfectly recruited themſelves of all their Fatigues, and very well inriched themſelves at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in ſo good a winter Quarter. Thus the Army, to which diverſe new <hi>Cruſades</hi> had come to joyn themſelves, and which was in a Condition as good or better, than when it firſt marched out of <hi>Germany;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning he began his March, and quitting the left hand Way, which he had found was ſo difficult and dangerous, when he accompanied his Uncle the Emperor <hi>Conrade,</hi> he took to the Right, by the Sea Coaſt, croſſing over <hi>Myſia, Troas, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> by the Cities of <hi>Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> to the <hi>Meander,</hi> which he paſſed near <hi>Laodicea,</hi> where the Army repoſed for a few days. The Inhabitants of this City furniſhed them with all manner

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> with an incredible Chearfulneſs, which was a pleaſing Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to the Emperor, who now believed that the Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment extended as far as that ſide of the <hi>Meander,</hi> would inviolably keep his Promiſe, which he had given him, and which he daily repeated by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who followed the Camp. But he was no ſooner arrived at that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mountain, which is near the Head of the <hi>Meander,</hi> and which the defeat of the Rereguard of the <hi>French</hi> Army, under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young, had made ſo Memorable, but he found the Enemies in the Head of him, and preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that this perfidious Infidel Prince, had not made him all thoſe fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but to draw him into the Snare, which he had artfully had by his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Treachery. Which ſhould inſtruct Chriſtian Princes, that they ought to take all imaginable Precaution, and extraordinary Security, when the neceſſity of their Affairs obliges them to treat with thoſe People, who wanting that true Faith which they owe to God, uſually take no care of preſerving it towards Men.</p>
                  <p>This Sultan was <hi>Caïſcoſroës,</hi> who about ten years before had been diſpoiled of his Dominions by his Brother <hi>Rucratin,</hi> and was afterwards re-eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> This Prince had a little before concluded an Alliance with <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had given his Daughter in Marriage to his Son <hi>Melich,</hi> who ſucceeded him. He had alſo a ſecret Intelligence with <hi>Iſaacius,</hi> who correſponded with both theſe Sultans againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> whom he mortally hated, as do all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but more eſpecially in thoſe times: So that all the Ambaſſadors which this perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Infidel had ſent to <hi>Frederick,</hi> and whom <hi>Iſaacius</hi> had apparently by Force detained at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were ſent for no other Purpoſe but to abuſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with greater eaſe, and to draw him from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> into thoſe deſert Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, from whence he had cauſed all the Proviſions to be withdrawn, that ſo he might deſtroy that Army by Famine, and by the infinite multitude of Troops, which he had gathered out of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> continually to moleſt the Army in their March, and to attack them at all the difficult Paſſes. In ſhort, they found that the Straits of the Mountain were poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but nevertheleſs, they were ſuch miſerable Cowards, that would not abide more than the firſt Shock of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who there made a great Carnage among them, and put the reſt to flight. However they rallied the next Morning, and came again in far greater Numbers, but rather like Thieves than Souldiers, vexing the Army on all Sides with ſlinging great Stones, and diſcharging their Arrows, after which they would ſave themſelves according to their Cuſtom, by retireing at full Speed, and then preſently return again after the ſame manner, without giving the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were heavily armed, the poſſibility of coming to Blows with them; and having thus combated with them all the Day, they in the Night ſeized upon the Avenues of another Mountain, which were extraordinary ſtrait, and through which they knew the Chriſtian Army muſt neceſſarily paſs the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Day.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Frederick,</hi> who diſpoſed all things with an incredible preſence of Mind, thought of a pretty Stratagem, which ſucceeded perfectly to his Wiſh. He divided his Army into two Bodies, leaving the ſmalleſt Party in the Camp, which was at the Foot of the Mountain; after which, ſeeming to be afraid of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to diſpair of forcing the Paſs, he marched in the Morning with the greateſt Party quite another way, as if he deſigned to find ſome other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. He was not diſtanced far from the Camp, when the <hi>Turks</hi> really believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Fear was the occaſion of his Flight, and the haſt which he made to draw himſelf out of ſuch a dangerous Place, had made him abandon his Camp; but that the deſire they had of Plunder, and that Avarice which is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> blinded them in ſuch ſort, that abandoning their advantageous Poſt, they tumbled down from the Mountain in the greateſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, to fall upon the Camp, which they believed they ſhould rifle at their Diſcretion, finding it without Defence. But thoſe who guarded it, ſhewed them their Miſtake, and defended it ſo vigorouſly, that the Emperor making a ſhort Turn, upon a Signal which was given him by Fire and Smoak, charged them upon their Backs; ſo that being ſhut in between two powerful Bodies, they were moſt of them cutt in Pieces, and the reſt ſcattered, leaving the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage free to the victorious Army.</p>

                     <hi>Frederick</hi> nevertheleſs found it very difficult to believe that he was betrayed by the Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> in regard that his Ambaſſadors were ſtill in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and they always highly diſavowed theſe to be their Maſters Troops; but it was not long before he came to be diſabuſed; for about the Feaſt of the Aſcenſion, which was the third Day of <hi>May,</hi> the Ambaſſadors took the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Night to ſteal away, forcing along with them <hi>Godfrey</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Interpreter; and in the ſame place where the Sultan <hi>Chiſiaſtlan,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this, had defeated the Army of the Emperor <hi>Manuel,</hi> about fourteen Years before, he found more than thirty thouſand Men imbodied into an Army, to oppoſe his Paſſage in the Straits, which might eaſily be maintained by a very inconſiderable Number. The <hi>Turks</hi> had gathered great heaps of Stones, that ſo they might, from the high Rocks, ſhower them down out of their Slings, upon the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> upon whom alſo they might with eaſe tumble down huge pieces of the Craggs, which they had before looſened for that purpoſe. But <hi>Frederick,</hi> very dexterouſly drew the Army out of that Danger alſo; for having promiſed to a certain Priſoner, that he would give him his Life, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he ſhould, as he offered for that Favour, conduct the Army by another way over the Top of this Mountain, which was three Miles in the Aſcent, he paſſed it the ſame Day, though not without great Difficulty, and with the Loſs of above a thouſand Horſes, and as many Beaſts of Burthen, who tumbled over the Precipices on the one Side and the other.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he was deſcended into the Plain, he incamped there, to refreſh his Army a little in that place, which was very commodious, in regard of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Forrage: But the <hi>Turks,</hi> who with their dreadful Multitude filled all the Country, having run from all parts during the whole Night, the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fell upon the Rereguard, whileſt that another Party of them having cut them off from the Van, charged them in the Front. This was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt dangerous Combats which happened in all the Voyage; but the Dukes of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Baden,</hi> who commanded that Body, combated with ſo much Courage and Conduct, that they forced the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to a ſhameful Flight, after their having left a great many of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dead upon the place, and without ſo much as the Loſs of one Man, though there were a great many wounded; and among them <hi>Frederick</hi> the Son of the Emperor, who had two of his Teeth broaken out by a Blow from a Sling; a great part alſo of the Baggage was loſt; the leſs Valiant among the <hi>Turks,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Opportunity of the heat of the Fight, to fall upon thoſe who guarded it: After this, as the Troops of the Enemies increaſed daily more and more, they gave ſuch continual Alarms, that the Souldiers were forced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually to ſtand to their Arms to defend themſelves againſt theſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who attacked them Night and Day without Intermiſſion, though they were continually beaten; and that one time among many, that they ventured to attack the Camp by Night, there were ſlain above ſix thouſand of them, and among the reſt, one hundred ſeventy four of their moſt conſiderable Officers.</p>
                  <p>But after all, Theſe Victories could not deliver the Army from the moſt terrible and dangerous of their Enemies, which was Famine; for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which they had carried with them, being either conſumed by ſo long a March, or loſt with the Sumpters and that part of the Baggage which had been taken, and all the Country being either Barren or Uninhabited, or deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Enemies, who made a horrible Waſt throughout; the Army was forced to kill the Mules, and Horſes, which would otherwiſe have been loſt for want of Forrage; ſo that there remained but a few of them, and they ſo feeble and meagre, that their Maſters were ſo far from receiving the Benefit of being carried by them upon their March, that they were forced to walk on foot, and lead them by the Bridles: Inſomuch that I cannot but relate a pretty Adventure which happened thereupon, and which the Hiſtorian <hi>Nicetas,</hi> as much a <hi>Greek</hi> all over as he was, yet thought fit to dedicate to the Memory of Poſterity, as a Prodigy of Valour, comparable even to the Fables which have been invented, to frame the Heroes of the firſt Ages. A certain <hi>German</hi> Cavaleer, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Force and Stature, being mighty unwilling to part with his Horſe, who by reaſon of his Poverty was in no condition to carry him, marched on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64918:95"/>foot,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> leading him ſoftly at a good Diſtance from the reſt of his Troop, when he was preſently ſet upon by fifty of the ſtouteſt among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly hovered about the Army, and who all together diſcharged their Arrows againſt him; but this valiant Man regarding them with a Look fierce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous, received them all upon a Buckler, with which his left Arm was covered, through which he had put his Bridle, by which he held his Horſe; and holding his Sword in his other hand, he kept ſtill on his Way, without ſo much as once ſtopping or turning, till at laſt, a <hi>Turk</hi> more reſolute than his Companions, leaving his Bow, and putting Spurs to his Horſe, came galloping upon him with his Sable in his Hand, and with all his Force diſcharged a mighty Blow upon the <hi>German,</hi> which had no more effect than if he had ſtruck it againſt a Rock; whereupon the fierce <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndaunted,</hi> perceiving that he could not make a ſure Blow at the Rider, who was too high for him, he with a dreadful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe cut off both the Horſes Foreleggs at the Knees, and the poor Animal at the inſtant ſinking upon his Stumps, the Rider ſtill ſitting in the Saddle, he diſcharged ſuch a horrible Blow upon his Head, that he cut him quite down to the very Saddle, and wounded the Horſe into the Bargain. This ſo affrighted his Companions, as well it might, that taking the Souldier for ſome <hi>Daemon,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for a Man, they betook themſelves to their Spurs, as if the Devil had drive them, leaving the Hero coolly, and at leiſure to purſue his way to the Camp, where he arrived a good while after the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor all this time, ſtill advanced towards <hi>Iconium,</hi> with a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Periſh or to take that City, and both to puniſh the Sultan for his Perfidy, and to refreſh his Army after ſo many Fatigues. For this Reaſon therefore, theſe cowardly <hi>Barbarïans</hi> fearing ſuch an Affront, and believing on the other ſide, that they had to do, with Men half dead with Famine, reſolved at length, to expect them in the open Field, and with all their Forces to put it to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Battle. And therefore having muſtered up all their Troops, which compoſed an Army of more than three hundred thouſand Combatants, upon the eleventh day of <hi>May,</hi> they appeared in View of the Chriſtian Army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of <hi>Melich,</hi> the eldeſt Son of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> He extended his Troops to the right and left upon the Heights which he had poſſeſſed himſelf of all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, as far as the Sight would reach, that thereby he might ſtrike a Terror into the Hearts of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> who after having loſt ſo great numbers of their Souldiers, and the greateſt part of their Horſes, by the defect of Forrage and Proviſions, in ſuch a difficult March of three Months, appeared but as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in compariſon of ſuch a fearful Multitude of their Enemies. The Emperor, who was one of the greateſt Captains of the World, took occaſion to draw an Advantage from this Action of the Enemies, who did it for their own, and to terrify the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the View of all their Forces, which were to be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eaſily from their Poſts; for he put on a counterfeit Amazement, and after having well diſſembled a Fear, by the little Aſſurance of his Countenance, and the many Changes which he made in the order of his Battle, he cauſed his Troops to move in ſuch a ſort of Countermarch, as gave the <hi>Turks</hi> a firm Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion that he had not the leaſt Intention to Fight, but rather how to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a Retreat. Hereupon the firſt Squadrons of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Victory was already as good as in their Hands, and that they had nothing more to do, but to change this Retreat into a manifeſt Flight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Mountains into the Plain with ſo much Precipitation, that they galloped with a looſe Rein, and in great Diſorder, with dreadful Cries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Cuſtom, after theſe ſuppoſed Fugitives. But they ſoon found their Miſtake, for the <hi>Germans</hi> turning Head imediately upon them, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with their Swords, quickly made them fly in good Earneſt, after having left a great many ſtretching upon the place, to ſave themſelves in Haſt and Confuſion upon the Mountains, with the groſs of their Army, which was not yet come down. The two following Days paſſed in light Skirmiſhes, but upon the third, which was the morrow after <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> there was a neceſſity of coming to a general Battle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melich,</hi> who had too many Troops to be able to range them commodiouſly in the Ground of which he was poſſeſſed, divided his Army into two great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64918:95"/>which he poſted the one behind the other,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> upon two Hills which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by a little Valley, that ſo he might be able to ſend what Troops he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the ſecond Hill, to ſuſtain thoſe who were upon the firſt. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the firſt Body in Perſon, his Brothers being at the Head of the other, which ſerved as a Rereguard. The Emperor himſelf, on his ſide, led the Van, and the Command of the Rere he gave to his Son, the Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> who had order to ſuſtain him, by inſtantly following of him, to the end that they might make the more powerful Effort, by charging both together, almoſt at the ſame time, upon the firſt Body of the Enemies. Now the Aſcent of the Hill upon which they ſtood in Battalia, being not very ſteep, the Emperor, after he had paſſed the prodigious Diſcharge of their Arrows and Stones, which had little Effect, charged upon the firſt Squadrons of his Enemies; after which, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Cuſtom, they made ſome Reſiſtance, whereas uſually their manner of Fight, was like that of the ancient <hi>Parthians,</hi> from whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, in vaulting about, and returning to the Charge after they had wheeled off, but this Reſiſtance laſted but a little time, for theſe ſort of People, who were better acquainted with robbing and killing, than with this manner of ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not being able to ſuſtain the furious Shock of theſe <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe very Countenances ſtruck them with Terrour, and who dealt about luſty Blows of Pike, Sword, and Battle-Axes, and made a dreadful Slaughter among ſuch as either durſt abide their Force, or had not the Opportunity to avoid it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed few of them had, by reaſon of the greatneſs of their Number, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the nimbleneſs of their Flight; ſo that of the boldeſt of them, who for ſome time maintained the cloſe Fight, above ten thouſand lay ſtretched out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Place. <hi>Melich,</hi> who behaved himſelf very gallantly, was overthrown by a Blow of the Lance, and four of the Sultan's principal Noblemen, were ſlain by his Side; nor was it without extreme Difficulty and Hazard, that being quickly re-mounted again, and ſeeing that all his Vanguard was intirely defeated, he ſaved himſelf upon the Hill, where the Rereguard, commanded by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſtood in Battalia. But that ſtood but a ſmall time; it was already half defeated, by the Fear which ſeized thoſe Troops, in ſeeing the woful Slaughter of their Companions of the Van; and the Flight of the General, who in ſaving himſelf with the Flyers, carried alſo the Terrour and the Confuſion among the other Squadrons; ſo that as ſoon as ever they ſaw the Emperor, who marched over the Bellies of all thoſe whom he found in the Valley, advanced gently, and in good Order againſt them, they preſently fled at full Speed, towards <hi>Iconium,</hi> having the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtill at their Backs, who purſued them until it was Night.</p>
                  <p>That which is moſt marvellous in this Victory, is that the Conquerors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it without almoſt any Loſs; which many attributed to the particular Protection of St. <hi>George</hi> and St. <hi>Victor,</hi> which are the ordinary Names that are called upon in Battle, and whom ſome affirmed that they ſaw combat with the <hi>Turks</hi> before the Squadrons of the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> which muſt either be attributed to ſome extraordinary Effect of the Divine Commiſſion, as many times happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of the Scripture it ſelf, which relates to us the Sun's ſtanding ſtill in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moon in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> and that the Stars in their Courſes fought againſt proud <hi>Siſera,</hi> and that the Hailſtones, of prodigious bigneſs, the Artillery of Heaven, overthrew the Enemies of God and his People: Or elſe it is poſſible, it might be the effect of what diverſe of them had often heard related of the Celeſtial Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons which were reported to have been ſeen in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> at the famous Battle of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whoſe Imagination being therefore ſtrongly pre-poſſeſſed with the Impreſſions of thoſe Ideas, might upon this Occaſion frame to themſelves the like Apparitions: Be it as it will, this is certain, that a Cavaleer of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in no ſort to be thought an idle or dreaming Viſionary, whoſe Name was <hi>Lewis de Helfenſtein,</hi> affirmed it poſitively before the Emperor, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to him before the whole Army, upon his Oath, and upon the Faith of a vowed Pilgrim of the Holy Sepulchre, and of a <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that he had more than once ſeen St. <hi>George</hi> at the Head of the Squadrons, putting the Enemies to Flight. This was alſo afterwards confirmed by the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, who related that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64918:96"/>they ſaw,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> at the Head of the Chriſtian Army, certain Troops in white Arms, which were no where to be found among them. I muſt needs acknowledge, that one is not at all obliged to give Credit to theſe kind of Viſions, which for the moſt part are the Effects of great Illuſions; but I alſo know very well that an Hiſtorian hath no manner of Right, by the Warrant of his own Authority, to reject ſuch as are ſupported by Teſtimonies ſo remarkable as this is; and that if he be left at his own Liberty to disbelieve them as he ſhall pleaſe, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to the Liberty by ſuppreſſing them, to take from his Readers, the Right which they have after the reading them, to judge of them as they think fit.</p>
                  <p>Now as theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> did again, with the ſame eaſe as they had fled, rally themſelves, <hi>Melich</hi> having quickly re-aſſembled them before <hi>Iconium,</hi> ſent to let the Emperor know, from the Sultan his Father, that he was ready to permit him free Paſſage, and to furniſh him with all manner of Proviſions in Plenty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that he would, for Form ſake only, pay thirty thouſand Crowns, and oblige the <hi>Armenian Chriſtians,</hi> to yield to the Sultan thoſe Places which they held in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which the Hiſtorians of that time, do for this Reaſon, ſo often confound with <hi>Armenia.</hi> To this <hi>Frederick</hi> inſtantly anſwered, ſweetly and calmly, according to his manner, but magnificently, and always like <hi>Caeſar; That a</hi> Roman <hi>Emperor, eſpecially at the Head of an Army of</hi> Cruſades, <hi>going to deliver the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, was not acquainted with the way of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for his Paſſage with Silver, when he knew ſo readily how to open it more nobly, with the harder Metal of the glittering Steel, which he wore by his Side, and which the Sultan ſhould ere long find was a Key, that would not only let him out of his Country, but open to him the Gates, and give him Entrance into his Capital City of</hi> Iconium. And the following day, without ſtaying for any other Anſwer, he removed his Camp, which was already within View of <hi>Iconium,</hi> and advanced towards the City to attack it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iconium,</hi> which at this time is called <hi>Cogny,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> and of all the Dominions of this Sultan, which beſides this Province, extended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Piſidia, Cappadocia, Pamphilia,</hi> and <hi>Iſauria,</hi> which not long after was called <hi>Caramania,</hi> was afore this time a very good City, and well Fortified, where the <hi>Pacha</hi> Governour of the Province made his Reſidence. But it was at this time much Greater, more Rich and Populous, environed with good Walls, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a many fair Towers, of a wonderful Thickneſs, and extraordinary Height; and beſides it had in the faſhion of a Citadel, a very great Caſtle ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate upon a Mountain, which commanded the Town; and in the Opinion of a certain Writer, who was preſent at that War, the City was no way leſs than <hi>Cologne,</hi> which is one of the biggeſt and moſt conſiderable Cities of <hi>Germany.</hi> It was alſo very Beautiful without the Walls, there being on the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide a great Park incloſed with ſtone Walls, in which the Sultans had built two magnificent Palaces, for their Diverſion during the Heats of the Summer; there were alſo round about it abundance of Gardins, which made the coming to it on that part very pleaſing, but withal very difficult, by reaſon that there was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for the placing a great number of Souldiers, who might from thoſe Covertures diſcharge in great Security their Arrows, againſt thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. The Emperor nevertheleſs, having commanded every Horſeman to take a Footman behind him, that ſo upon their lighting, they might the better attack thoſe who defended theſe Incloſures, eaſily made himſelf Maſter of them, and there lodged all the Army, with a Reſolution the next Morning, being the twenty eighth of <hi>May,</hi> to Aſſault the City, though it was defended by a great part of the Enemies Army; whileſt the other part, which was re-inforced to the number of two hundred thouſand Men, was in the Field, ready to charge upon the Backs of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in caſe they attempted any thing againſt the Town.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon therefore as the Day appeared, the Emperor without deferring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Propoſitions of Peace, which the Sultan made only to amuſe him, divided the Army into two Bodies. He gave the Command of the firſt to the Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> his Son, accompanied with <hi>Florent</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> with Order to attack the City: And the other he commanded himſelf, to oppoſe the Enemies, if they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64918:96"/>ſhould attempt to fall upon them behind, during the Attack.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> Never was there any Enterpriſe that appeared more unadviſable, nor never any that did more happily ſucceed: For the Sultan, who was iſſued out to repulſe the Aſſailants, ſcarcely ſaw the foremoſt Squadrons, who ran upon him with their Lances conched, but that, being ſeized with the Cowardly Apprehenſion of Death, which he believed, without flying, was inevitable, he ignominiouſly ſhewed them his Back; and by his timerous Example, drew all his Troops after him; who fled with ſuch a Pannick Fear, that the <hi>Germans</hi> purſued them ſo briskly, as not to give them liberty to ſhut the Gates before they alſo were entred with them into the City. And no ſooner were they gotten in, but they put all to the Sword whom they met in the Streets and Market-places, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, thereby to oblige them to retire into their Houſes, and leave the Streets free. The Sultan, with great difficulty, ſaved himſelf in the Caſtle, with his Children, and that which was moſt conſiderable in the Court, being hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> who chaſed them with the Sword at their Backs, killing and ſlaying all that oppoſed him, or ſtood in his way, to the very Gates of the Fortreſs. Thus this great City was taken, by the fearful Diſorder oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Cowardly Timerouſneſs of one Man: And the Victors made themſelves Maſters of it, without almoſt any Loſs; rather owing it to the fear of the Vanquiſhed, than to their own Valour, ſince they found no Enemy that would give them occaſion to exerciſe it, in the Execution of a generous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
                  <p>All this time the Emperor, who knew nothing of the Succeſs of thoſe who attacked the City, was at hard Blows with the great Army of his Enemies; for they knowing that he had only a Moyety of the Army, charged him with more Reſolution than was cuſtomary to them, upon the hopes which they had, that they ſhould eaſily ſurround ſuch a little Army, which could not poſſibly reſiſt two hundred thouſand Men, who aſſailed him on all ſides at the ſame time. And, in truth, they aſſailed him in ſuch good Order, and with ſo much Vigour, drawing down upon him on every ſide, all together, with fearful Cries, and an infinite number of Darts, Arrows and Stones, which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from their Bows and Slings: Inſomuch, that the Chriſtians, who were ſo ſmall a number in Compariſon, and ſo harraſſed with the Fatigues of their March, and the Combats of the foregoing Days, and almoſt ſpoiled with the horrible Rain which had fallen all the Night before, began to deſpair, not only of the Victory, but of their Lives. The Biſhops themſelves, and the Prieſts, habited in their Rochets, Surplices and Stoles, who expected nothing the Stroak of Death, and to offer to God their Lives as a Sacrifice, however exhorted the Soldiers, with great Cries, to do the ſame, and expoſe theirs freely, after their Example. But the Emperor, ready, as he was, to die for the Love of Jeſus Chriſt, was yet reſolved, if it were poſſible, to live, and live a Conqueror for the Love of Glory; and therefore, galloping amongſt the Ranks, he animated them by his Voice and Geſture, and poſted to put himſelf at the Head of the foremoſt Squadrons; where regarding his People with Eyes which ſhot Fire into the very Bottom of the moſt frozen Courage, he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them the ſame Ardour with which his noble Heart was animated. <hi>What do you ſtand for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my generous Fellow-Soldiers? Let us go, Let us go under the conquering Enſign of the Death of Chriſt Jeſus, who calls us to the Victory: It is not in expecting Death from them, but in carrying it among our Enemies, that we muſt be Victors.</hi> And thereupon, ſetting Spurs to his Horſe, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the thickeſt Squadrons of the <hi>Turks,</hi> all covered with Sweat and Blood, as he was; and his Courage furniſhing him with new Forces, he laid about him, cutting, overturning and killing with mighty Blows of his Sword, on both ſides of him, all thoſe that durſt oppoſe his Fury. All his Soldiers, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his Example, and by ſeeing the danger to which their Prince expoſed himſelf for their ſakes, became, as it were, new Men; and as if they had but juſt freſhly begun the Combat, they followed him with ſo much Heat, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity and Fury, that thoſe Squadrons, unable to ſuſtain the terrible Shock, being overthrown upon thoſe who followed them, the Terrour ſpread it ſelf ſo among the reſt of the Army, that they preſently fell into Diſorder,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64918:97"/>and in a Moment after,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> into a downright Flight, and, according to the cuſtom of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſaved themſelves in the Mountains, leaving ten thouſand ſlain upon the place.</p>
                  <p>After this Execution, the Emperor, who was not willing to amuſe himſelf, by purſuing the Fugitives, lead his victorious Soldiers to the City, of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof he was by this time advertiſed; where he was received, as it were, in Triumph by his Son. He gave the Plunder of it to his Army, which there found Riches, even ſurpaſſing Imagination, and a prodigious quantity of all kind of Proviſions, to refreſh them, after ſo many Travels, Toyls and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. The Emperor had, among other things, for his ſhare, more than one hundred thouſand Marks in Gold and Silver, which was found in the Palace of <hi>Melich,</hi> and which was the Money, which <hi>Saladin</hi> had given him as a Portion with his Daughter. The next Day the Emperor cauſed Prayers to be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſung in <hi>Iconium,</hi> and Thanks to be given for a Victory ſo great and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The Sultan then, ſeeing himſelf beſieged in the Caſtle, from whence he could not eſcape, humbly demanded Peace of the Emperor, upon ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as he ſhould pleaſe: And <hi>Frederick,</hi> whoſe great deſign was to advance as faſt as poſſible towards <hi>Syria,</hi> to combat with <hi>Saladin,</hi> after having publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached this miſerable Sultan with his baſe Perfidiouſneſs, did him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promiſe him, that he would reſtore the City to him in the Condition wherein it was, provided only that he ſhould furniſh him with Proviſions for all the time he marched through his Dominions; and that for a Warranty of the Performance of his Word, he ſhould put into his hands, as Hoſtages, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the greateſt Perſons of his Court, whom the Emperor ſhould chuſe; and that, after the Repoſe of ſeven days, wherein his Army was to be Quartered, partly in the Town, and partly in the Sultan's Park, he would take his March, and quit the City, as he alſo did, on the 30th Day of <hi>May,</hi> arriving at <hi>Laran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> upon the Frontier of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> at the Foot of Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> from whence, nevertheleſs, he did not releaſe the Hoſtages, in regard that his Subjects had again moleſted the Army upon their March.</p>
                  <p>The Mountain <hi>Taurus</hi> is the greateſt, and the higheſt, of all thoſe of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and which, taking different Names in the ſeveral Provinces through which it paſſeth, or which it divides from one another, as well on this, as the further ſide of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> retains particularly the Name of <hi>Taurus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia;</hi> which it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from <hi>Iſauria, Lycaonia, Cappadocia,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Armenia,</hi> by a long Chain of Mountains and Rocks, extream broken and frightful; where it lifts up it ſelf upon the Sea-Coaſt, towards the Conſines of <hi>Iſauria,</hi> in which place it bends it ſelf in the form of a Creſcent: and after having formed this great Demicircle, it comes to a Butt upon the ſame Sea, upon the Eaſt, near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Iſſus,</hi> ſo celebrated, for the Battle which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great gained againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> in the Straits of theſe Mountains. They are for the moſt part, by reaſon of their exceſſive heighth, covered with Snow, that there is no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, but in Summer; and then ſo broken with Precipices, ſo ſteep and ragged, that they are wholly inacceſſible, except by three Paſſes, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream narrow, and difficult of Acceſs: So that they are called by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Piles, or Ports, by one of which there is a neceſſity of paſſing, to enter into <hi>Cilicia.</hi> It was by that, of theſe three, which leads towards <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> that the Emperor, after having repoſed ſome time at <hi>Laranda,</hi> began to engage himſelf in the Paſſage of theſe Mountains, which could not be performed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days, and with a great deal of difficulty. He received, during this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Paſſage, with abundance of Joy, <hi>Livon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Rupin de la Montagne,</hi> who, with the principal Perſons of that Country, came to wait upon him, and pay him their Reſpects; offering all that they had, at his Service, for his Accommodation. After they had taken their leave of him, leaving ſix of them to accompany him, he at laſt accompliſhed this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Paſſage, the 10th of <hi>June;</hi> and diſ-incumbring himſelf of theſe tireſom Rocks, he deſcended into the Valley, which is watered by the River <hi>Cydnus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This River ariſeth out of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> in the Coaſt of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> from whence, entring into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> by one of theſe Valleys, which are formed by theſe Mountains, it rowls its gentle Streams, extream clear and freſh, upon its mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64918:97"/>Bed of clean Gravel and Pebbles; and is not very ſpacious tiil,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> having paſſed through the famous City of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> it diſchargeth it ſelf into the Ocean. Hiſtory hath made this River famous, by the extream danger which <hi>Alexander</hi> there run of loſing his Life, whilſt in the Heat of Summer, being all on fire with the violence of the burning Seaſon, he would needs bath himſelf in theſe too cool Streams of <hi>Cydnus,</hi> being then upon his March againſt <hi>Darius.</hi> But an Accident more deplorable, which here happened to the Emperor <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> by the very ſame way, ought for ever to render the Memory of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal River odious. For the very ſame day, which was a <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Eve of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> this great Prince, after having dined upon the Bank of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which he had juſt paſſed, ſeeing the Water, which to him ſeemed very delightful, and not able to ſupport the intollerable Heat of that Seaſon of the Year, without making uſe of that Remedy which was ſo eaſie, and which he naturally loved, would needs bath himſelf in thoſe cool and refreſhing Streams, notwithſtanding all that was alledged to divert him from it: but he was no ſooner in the River, into the middle of which he threw himſelf, but that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Coldneſs of the Water ſeized him in a moment; and penetrating his Pores, which, by reaſon of the extream Heat, were ſo open, combated his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat and Spirits with ſo much Violence that, in a Swound, he ſunk down to the bottom of the Water. He was, however, taken up alive, and ſo ſoon as he began to return to his Memory, perceiving his death approaching, he gave Thanks unto Almighty God, who did him the favour to call him in his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and in the Performance of his Vow; and recommending his Soul into his Hands, and offering his Life in Sacrifice for the Remiſſion of his Sins, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently expired. I know that many Writers report the matter otherwiſe, and ſay, that his Horſe foundring in the Paſſage of the River, his Foot hung in the Stirrup, and ſo he was drowned, as he was paſſing into <hi>Armenia,</hi> over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Salef:</hi> but as the moſt ancient Hiſtorians, his Contemporaries, and ſome of them who were preſent, poſitively, ſome of them, affirm, it was the River <hi>Cydnus:</hi> And others of them ſay, it was a River near <hi>Tarſus,</hi> in which he was drowned, ſwimming after Dinner; and that one of them informs us, that he died not till the Evening. In my Opinion, there is not the leaſt place left for deliberation, which of them we ought to believe; eſpecially conſidering that it is very eaſie to reconcile theſe Hiſtorical Differences, by what was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it was then very cuſtomary to confound <hi>Armenia</hi> with <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and that the River <hi>Salef</hi> is the ſame <hi>Cydnus,</hi> as the Annaliſt <hi>Roger</hi> gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by the Deſcription which he makes of thoſe Countries.</p>
                  <p>Thus died one of the greateſt Princes that ever ſilled the Throne of the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, Frederick</hi> the Firſt, in the ſeventieth Year of his Age, whilſt he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to combat <hi>Saladin,</hi> for the Re-Conqueſt of the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to which important Deſign, he had levelled the Way, by all thoſe Victories which he had ſo gloriouſly gained againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and the Sultan of <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> the Allies of <hi>Saladin.</hi> The ſole Renown of the Actions of this invincible Prince ſtruck that famous Conqueror with ſo great a fear, that upon the very Rumour and Noiſe of his Coming, deſpairing to be able to maintain them againſt him, he cauſed the Walls of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> of <hi>Giblet, Tortoſa, Biblis, Berytus</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> to be demoliſhed; and had thoughts himſelf of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he might not be obliged to hazard his Fortune againſt that of an Enemy ſo ſucceſsful and formidable. He was happy in finiſhing a Life ſo illuſtrious, in the Courſe of his Victories, and before giddy Fortune, who never loves to court one Favourite long, had begun to forſake him: but much more happy in a Death ſo full of Glory, and of Deſerts before God and Men, ſince he died in the generous Purſuit of his great Deſign, in quitting his own Empire, to re-eſtabliſh that of Jeſus Chriſt, in that myſterious Spot of Ground, where he was pleaſed to work, by his Life, and by his Death, the great Wonder of our Salvation. For thus it is that we ought charitably to judge of the Death of this Prince, by thoſe things which we know of him, and not according to the raſh, medling Humour of ſome, who will needs pretend to enter into the incomprehenſible Judgments of God, who have had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to attribute his Death to the Divine Vengeance, as a Puniſhment for the

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> Great Preſumption of Humane Nature! which, under the pretext of Religion and Piety, dares ſo audaciouſly undertake to regulate the Decrees of Heaven; and by a Judgment which, in its own nature, is extreamly criminal, to pre-judge that which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf only hath the Authority of giving, and which muſt be kept ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the laſt Day.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the general Conſternation, or rather the extream Deſpair, in which the Army was, by reaſon of this deplorable Accident, was a little over, the Princes and General Officers being aſſembled, by a common Conſent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> for their General; the Emperor, his Father, at his death, having recommended the Care of the Army to him, and left it under his Command. It was with as much Joy as was poſſibly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in ſuch a deep Affliction, that the Army took the Oath of Fealty to him, whom they acknowledged as the true Heir, and the living Image of all the great Qualities and Vertues of his Father. And this Prince, who in reallity poſſeſſed them in a degree very nearly approaching the Perfections of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Emperor, made it appear quickly that he was his true Succeſſor, by his Liberality, in beſtowing great Largeſſes upon the Soldiers, to whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the greateſt part of the Treaſure which fell to his Father's ſhare at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Iconium.</hi> After he had therefore divided the Army into two parts, the leſſer number imbarked on the Veſſels which the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who then held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> furniſhed him withal; and himſelf with the greater Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after having interred the Emperor's Entrails, and embalmed the Body of his Father, at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> took his way by Land towards <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he did not arrive till after a tedious March of ſix Weeks, wherein he ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, both by the defect of Proviſions, and by the continual Ambuſhes of the <hi>Turks.</hi> But the Abundance which he found in this great City, where he was moſt magnificently received, was more fatal to his Army, than either all the Want they had endured, or all the Combats they had undergone, ſince their parting from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for the Soldiers paſſing ſuddenly from one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream into another, there followed ſo much Sickneſs, ſuch a Mortality, and at laſt, the Plague among them, in ſuch a furious manner, that of a numerous and flouriſhing Army, which it was when it entred into <hi>Aſia,</hi> there remained not more than ſeven thouſand Foot, and five or ſix hundred Horſe; with which, notwithſtanding, the valiant <hi>Frederick</hi> marched over the Bellies of all that durſt oppoſe him, and happily arrived at the City of <hi>Tyre.</hi> There it was that he payed the laſt Duties to his Father, whom he cauſed to be interred in the great Church, with all the Magnificence and Ceremonies of a Funeral Pomp, worthy of ſo great an Emperor, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> from whom he received the Croſs, making his Elegy in a moſt admirable Funeral Oration.

                  <p>When <hi>Saladin,</hi> after a Years Impriſonment at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> gave Liberty to King <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> he exacted from him, among other hard Conditions, that he ſhould renounce all manner of Claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and to engage himſelf by a ſoremn Oath, to repaſs the Sea as ſoon as it was poſſible. But after he was at liberty, the Biſhops declared that this Oath was in no ſort obliging, in regard it was forced from him by Compulſion, and in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; and alſo becauſe <hi>Saladin</hi> himſelf had firſt violated his Faith, in not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his Priſoner ſo ſoon as <hi>Aſcalon</hi> was rendred to him, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                     <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Accon,</hi> or <hi>Acre,</hi> derives its Name from one of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was its Reſtorer, and was at that time, a fair and large City, lying upon the Coaſt of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Sea. It was of a Triangular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, the Baſe of it being towards the Eaſt, the two Sides towards the North and South, and the Point ended in a Rock, which advanced it ſelf a good ſpace into the Sea, upon the Weſt; where the Town becoming the narroweſt, abut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a great, high and ſtrong Tower, which was called the <hi>Fly-Tower,</hi> becauſe that formerly, in that place ſtood a Temple dedicated to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> which ſignifies the God of Flies. It alſo ſerved for a Watch-Tower, or Light-Houſe, to diſcover the Entry of the Haven, which lay towards the South, in a certain Bay which the Sea made in that place, which was very commodious, and capable of receiving great numbers of Ships. It was incompaſſed with very ſtrong Walls and Barbicans, or Out-Walls, with large and deep Ditches and Graffs; as alſo, with very good Towers, placed at convenient diſtances, to defend each other: The principal of theſe, which ſerved as a Caſtle and Fortreſs to the City, was called the <hi>Wicked Tower,</hi> by reaſon that the People, by an old ſottiſh Fable, which, according to Cuſtom, was held for an Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tradition among them, had a Belief that it was built with thoſe thirty Pieces of Money, for which <hi>Judas</hi> ſold our Saviour. The Country adjacent was very pleaſant, being a fair and rich Champaign, which upon the North, was bounded by Mount <hi>Saron,</hi> diſtant about two Leagues from the City; and upon Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> on the South, much about the ſame diſtance; towards the Eaſt it was extended to the Mountains of <hi>Galilee,</hi> from whence there aroſe two ſmall Rivers, one whereof paſſing through the City, emptied it ſelf into the Sea, at the Haven: The other, called <hi>Belus,</hi> flows about two hundred and fifty Paces from the City, Southwards, and is famous for having been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Invention of Glaſs, by furniſhing the Materials of which it was firſt made.</p>
                  <p>For about the middle of its Courſe, it forms a kind of a Lake, or Mariſh, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls, the Lake of <hi>Cyndevia,</hi> of a round Figure, which may be ſome hundred Cubits in Compaſs, the Bottom whereof is full of a certain Sand which by the Winds is driven into it from the Tops of the adjacent Hills, where it obtains a Diſpoſition which inclines it eaſily to be turned into Glaſs; for being boiled and puriſied in a Furnace, it turns into a tranſparent Maſs, white and clear, almoſt like Cryſtal: And that which is moſt wondrous, any ſmall piece of this Cryſtal being thrown upon the Banks of this Lake, in little time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains its former Nature, and is converted into the ſame common Sand which it was, before it was blown by the Winds into this Lake. But though this Champaign about <hi>Ptolemais</hi> be very equal and level towards the Foot of the Mountains which inviron it, yet there are two Hills near the Town; the one of which is called <hi>Turon,</hi> which ſome have confounded with the famous Caſtle of <hi>Thoron,</hi> ſituate ſome three or four Leagues from thence, upon the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Mountains of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which extend themſelves to the upper <hi>Galilee:</hi> The other is called the Hill of the <hi>Moſquee,</hi> on the other ſide the River <hi>Belus;</hi> upon which, beſides that <hi>Moſquee</hi> of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> is to be ſeen an ancient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, which they ſay is that of <hi>Memnon,</hi> though without giving us preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Foundation whereupon to eſtabliſh that Belief. This was the nature of this place, which proved the Theatre of ſo many brave Actions as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at this Siege of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which one may well ſay, was one of the moſt memorable which is related in any Hiſtory.</p>

King <hi>Baldwin</hi> l. regained it from the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> in the Year 1104. in twenty four days, by the help of the Fleet of the <hi>Genoeſe;</hi> and after the unfortunate Battle of <hi>Tiberias, Saladin</hi> conſtrained it to ſurrender in two days; but the <hi>Christians</hi> under King <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> to re-take it from <hi>Saladin,</hi> laid Siege to it, which laſted more than three Years; where the gallant Actions which were done upon one ſide and the other, with all the Forces of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> which were there employed, either to attack it, or defend it, have rendred it moſt celebrated to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>The King therefore being reſolved to have this Town, that ſo he might, at leaſt, have one in his Realm, and one by which he might with Convenience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Succours of the Weſt, began to form his Siege againſt it about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1188. with his little Army, which the <hi>Saraſins</hi> of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> looked upon with ſuch Contempt, that they did not think it worth the ſhutting of their Gates againſt him: And, in truth, he had not above ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and about eight or nine thouſand Foot, compriſing the <hi>Piſans,</hi> which the Archbiſhop of that place had brought to the Succour of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and whom the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat</hi> had driven out of <hi>Tyre,</hi> by reaſon that he eſpouſed the Intereſt of <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> did that of the Marquis. There were in <hi>Ptolemais</hi> four times the number of Soldiers, under very good Officers, whom <hi>Saladin</hi> had placed there, to oppoſe the Garriſon of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and to preſerve that Port; which being in the middle of his Conqueſts, was moſt convenient to receive the Fleet which he was rigging in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The King nevertheleſs, who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave Men, and who believed that he might draw ſome Advantage from this fooliſh Preſumption of his Enemies, and from the Contempt which they had of this ſmall number, did not fail to attack the place; and he did it ſo briskly, ſome attempting the Gates, which were open, and others preſenting the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade at thoſe places where the Walls were loweſt, that they had infallibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Town at that very time, if that firſt Fury had not been daſhed by an unlucky Report which was ſpread about, and which they afterwards found ſalfe; that <hi>Saladin,</hi> with a powerful Army, was coming to fall upon their Rear: for without giving himſelf the leiſure to examine whether the Report were true or falſe, this poor Prince, who was accuſed to be very defective in point of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, was ſo terrified with the very Shadow of <hi>Saladin,</hi> that he immediately cauſed the Retreat to be founded, and went and fortified himſelf upon the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of <hi>Turon,</hi> thinking now of nothing but to ſtrengthen his Camp, and expect the Succours of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who, during the War between the two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> arrived daily, one after another, in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the firſt Errour which <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan</hi> committed during this Siege, which was occaſioned by the too great Apprehenſion of Danger, where there was really none. And at the ſame time <hi>Saladin</hi> fell into another, no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour on his part, in that he had not taken ſufficient Pre-caution againſt what might happen: For that Prince, who then beſieged the Fortreſs of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> which lay upon the River <hi>Eleutherus,</hi> ſome five or ſix Leagues from <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> and which belonged to the Knights of the <hi>Temple;</hi> having underſtood that <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan</hi> had undertaken the Siege of that City, he thanked God, that he had put his Enemies into his Hands, and that he had now the Opportunity to deſtroy the Remainder of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were come, he ſaid, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their own Chains. And as thoſe who applauded this brave Speech adviſed him, immediately to lay hold of ſo fair an Occaſion to defeat them, as then preſented it ſelf; he made Anſwer, That the Victory being indubitable, he was reſolved that his Brother, who was to joyn him within a few days, ſhould not loſe his ſhare in the pleaſure of it: but he became inſtructed by a chargeable Experiment, ſomething with the lateſt for ſo great a Captain, <hi>That in Martial Affairs, the Loſs of Time is an irreparable Error;</hi> and that, deferring the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is to be done in a Critical Conjuncture, which is not to be fixed according to Fancy and Imagination, is never to be recovered: For Victory,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> Negligence or Preſumption of a Captain, permits it to ſlide from between his Hands. For <hi>Saladin</hi> coming in ſome time after with an Army of an hundred Thouſand men to attack the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom he believed he ſhould defeat without any diſpute, found he was in a mighty miſtake and that though he had to do with an Army which was much leſs than his own, yet they were far more Valiant and much augmented in Numbers in Compariſon of what they were at the firſt. And in Fact it was compoſed of very gallant men, who having retrenched themſelves moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly upon the Hill of <hi>Turon,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Furious Attacks which he made both Night and Day, he was not able to force their Camp, but was at laſt conſtrained to incamp himſelf at the Foot of the Hill which he totally ſurrounded, to beſiege theſe Beſiegers, not doubting in the leaſt but he ſhould have them at his Diſcretion in a little time for want of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>And certainly the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who had neither Force enough to fight him in the Plain Field, no Proviſions ſufficient to maintain their Camp, for any long time, muſt have been reduced to very fatal Extremities, when there appeared in a ſuddain a great Fleet of above Fifty Ships who with full Sail bore directly afore the Wind towards the Shoar. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who from the Top of the Hill eaſily diſcovered this Navy, were preſently under the Apprehenſions, that this might be the Naval Force of <hi>Saladin</hi> which was daily expected out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and thoſe who were on Board, ſeeing from far a Camp upon the Top of that Hill, were reciprocally ſuſpicious, that it was the Camp of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who having gotten Intelligence of the great Preparations in <hi>Europe,</hi> for the Succour of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> attended their Landing there, with a Reſolution to fight them and prevent their Deſcent. But when the Fleet drawing nearer, both the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Camp perceived the Croſs in the Enſigns of the Ships which they wore upon the Poopes, and thoſe who were aboard ſaw the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playd in the Colours of the Camp, they mutually faluted each other with great Shouts of Joy, which preſently informed <hi>Saladin</hi> of the Arrival of Succours, which was in a few Moments repeated by an agreable Surpriſe, in the diſcovery of another Fleet more numerous then the firſt, which came from the Coaſt of <hi>Tyre</hi> to reinforce the Camp of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt was a Fleet of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Friſons,</hi> to which were joyned ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were reſolved not to ſtay till the two Kings were accorded to make their Voyage to the Holy Land.

                  <p>I have been willing contrary to my Cuſtom to make this Genealogick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, to ſhew how eaſie it is for Writers to be deceived in theſe kind of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by miſtaking ſometimes the place of their Birth for that of the Seigniory; and that when by ſuch an Equivocal Slip one comes to be perſwaded that a man is deſcended from ſuch a Houſe, into which Genealogical Stemm having graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him they preſently find out for him ſuch imaginary Fathers, Mothers and Grandfathers as never were in being, as they have done for this Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Second. And for this reaſon it is that I have not given my ſelf or the Reader much Trouble in diſcuſſing the Genealogies of thoſe perſons of whom I have Occaſion to ſpeak in this Work, in regard that is not only very troubleſome, but uncertain, unprofitable, Invidious and Vain, and in no ſort proper for an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who ought to leave ſuch Reſearches to thoſe who make it their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Deſign to record the Hiſtory of ſome Illuſtrious Houſe.</p>
                  <p>To return therefore to my Subject, <hi>James</hi> Lord of <hi>Aveſnes,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> one of the moſt renowned Captains of his Age, being deſirous to imitate the Zeal of <hi>Gerard d' Aveſnes</hi> one of his Anceſtors who was in the firſt <hi>Cruſade,</hi> joyned theſe Princes with a good Troop of his Subjects. So that theſe generous <hi>French</hi> all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made more then ten thouſand brave men, who burning with an earneſt Deſire as ſoon as poſſible to combat the <hi>Infidels</hi> had not the Power to wait till the two Kings ſhould be in a Condition to accompliſh their Vow, but cauſed a Fleet at their own Charges to be rigged out at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> from whence in thirty five days time they arrived proſperouſly in the Road of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> at the ſame time, that the <hi>Dains Friſons</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> came to an Anchor in the ſame place; ſo that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they formed a very fair Army.</p>
                  <p>The other Fleet was that of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who had gone to Sea to reinforce the Army of the Emperor, under the Conduct of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Thuringia</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> who coming to ride before the Port of <hi>Tyre,</hi> had at length perſwaded the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was before frequently ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch as came from the beſieged Army upon the Hill <hi>Turon,</hi> to joyn his Fleet with theirs, ſo that weighing Anchor with about twenty two thouſand Soldiers

So that <hi>Saladin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he had two powerful Armies in the Head of him, whoſe landing he could not oppoſe without expoſing himſelf to be attacked by thoſe who were incamped on the Hill, drew off into another Eminence oppoſite to that of <hi>Turon</hi> and there retrenched himſelf, in Expectation of Reinforcements, which were marching towards him from all Quarters. But the Captains of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army in a few days, having alſo received freſh Supplies of <hi>Cruſades, French</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians,</hi> and ſeeing they had more Forces then the <hi>Christians</hi> had ever before had ſince their coming into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as alſo that it would be difficult to force the Town in the View of ſuch a Potent Army as was that of <hi>Saladin,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at laſt to oblige him to a Battle, to which that Prince was already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inclined,</p>
                  <p>There was between the two Camps a fair and large Plain, where the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might with caſe range themſelves in Battle, and from the Hills they both deſcended as if it had been by concert, at break of day the fourteenth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> The Chriſtian Army conſiſted in forty thouſand Horſe and a hundred thouſand Foot, which were divided into four Bodies, drawn up in three Lines, the firſt which made the right Wing, wherein the King would command was compoſed of his own Troops, with thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Second which was the left, was commanded by the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who beſides his own Troops which were the beſt in all the Eaſt, had alſo thoſe which <hi>Eudes</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> who were of his Party, had brought to him.

And the fourth which was the Body of Reſerve, was conducted by <hi>Gerrard de Bibesford</hi> Great Maſter of the Temple accompanied with his Knights, and the <hi>Germans</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> who had joyned the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Marſeilles.

The Cavalry was ranged in the Intervals of the Battallions of the Second Line; and the Light-Horſe, being all Archers, were in the Front, followed by the men at Armes, who were all of the Nobility, who had acquired great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Wars of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in whom conſiſted the Principal Strength of the Army.</p>
                  <p>On the other Side <hi>Saladin</hi> whoſe Army was by much more Numerous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in an Hundred thouſand Horſe, and more Foot, divided this great Army into ſeven Bodies; he put ſix into two Lines which he oppoſed to thoſe of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the ſeventh was for a Reſerve, beſides the Troops which he left for the Guard of the Camp. Never was there ſeen greater Ardour or Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, than appeared upon this Day; there was not ſo much as one Soldier who made the leaſt doubt of a certain Victory, and who did not look upon the <hi>Turks</hi> as a Booty abandoned to them, to inrich themſelves with their Spoils; and there was one among the Captains, who ſeeing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſo many brave men as compoſed this flouriſhing Army, the like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had never been ſeen in the Holy Land, cried out by a horrible Truſport of his Indignation and a Preſumption too juſtly to be blamed as Criminala, <hi>is tthere hen any Power in all</hi> Aſia, <hi>which can be capable of reſiſting us in the Condition wherein we are? It is impoſſible for me not to deſpiſe this Multitude of Enemies which face us; and if God Almighty will but ſtand Neuter without aiding the one or the other Part, we are moſt aſſured of the Victory, ſince we have nothing elſe to do but to march to it over the Bellies of all this Army which oppoſes us.</hi> Inſupportable Vanity of the Spirit of Mankind! which ſo eaſily loſeth it ſelf in the Fooliſh <hi>Ideas</hi> which its frames of its own Strength, which in reallity without his Help is nothing but miſerable Weakneſs, as too plainly appeared in the Iſſue of this Battle.

                  <p>For firſt the Soldiers, who ought to have purſued their Point, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chace to the Enemies to hinder their rallying, immediately fell upon the Camp, which Fear had cauſed thoſe who guarded it to abandon, and fell to plundering, eſpecially the Tents of <hi>Saladin,</hi> which were repleniſhed with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Riches; nor was it in the Power of the Captains to prevent this diſorder, ſo much did the Sight of thoſe magnificent Pavilions, all ſhining with Silk and Gold, inflame the Covetouſneſs of the Soldiers, who gave ear to nothing but the Dictates of their Greedy Avarice. Now <hi>Saladin</hi> who was a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and perceived this Diſorder, failed not to make his Advantage of it, and therefore according to the Cuſtom of theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſo conformable to their Predeceſſors, the Ancient <hi>Parthians,</hi> they were as quickly rallied as they had been quickly routed; of all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, there remained none in the Field of Battle, beſides the great Maſter of the Temple, who with his Body, without runing to the Spoil, as did the reſt, purſued the Victory in very good Order. <hi>Saladin</hi> finding himſelf incomparably the Stronger, after the Rallyment which he had made, and not doubting in the leaſt, but he ſhould eaſily deal with the reſt, if he could only defeat this ſingle Body, which was that only which was in a Condition of fighting, marched inſtantly towards him and ſtopping him in the middle of his Courſe, obliged him to change his purſuit into a more regular Combat; the Fight was for a time on both ſides maintained with a moſt obſtinate Courage, and all the Vigour imaginable, the one fighting to preſerve the advantage and the Victory which they had already gotten, and the other to ſnatch it out of the Hands of theſe few who remained in order of Battle, and who could not expect to be relieved. But at length a new Re-inforcement, which <hi>Saladin</hi> did not in the leaſt expect, and who came juſt in the very Heat of the Fight, quite turned the Scale of Fortune to his ſide. It was five or ſix thouſand men, who during the Battle had iſſued out of the Town, and who having made a ſhew as if they would attack the Camp only to amuſe thoſe who defended it, turned ſhort to the left, to fall upon the Rere of thoſe whom they ſaw in ſo ſmall a number combating againſt their Party. So that this ſmall number being overpowered by the Multitude of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſurrounded them on all Parts, was at laſt conſtrained to give way, and endeavour to ſave themſelves in the beſt manner that they could, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the greateſt part of their Valiant Companions extended upon the Earth, and among others the Great Maſter, and the Steward of the Order, and eighteen or twenty of the braveſt Knights. <hi>Saladin</hi> without loſing any time turned ſhort towards his Camp, which was full of the diſorderly Soldiers of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were ſo buſie in plundering, that they had not ſo much as perceived this Action of <hi>Saladin.</hi> There was nevertheleſs ſome Rallyment
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64918:101"/>made by the Diligence of the Captains,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> who ſeeing the Danger wherein they were advanced, with thoſe Troops which they could draw together, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the firſt Effort of the Enemy; and ſome ſtill coming after others, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into Order of Battle as well as they could, they began again to renew the Combat, with ſome hope of regaining the advantage by their Valour, which they had loſt by their Indiſcretion. But it happened as it doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the greateſt Events depend upon the moſt trifling things, that a ridiculous Accident made them looſe anew all their Hopes, and put all into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Confuſion. For the <hi>Germans</hi> who had been the moſt greedy of the Booty as they had pillaged the Tents of <hi>Saladin,</hi> were endeavouring to get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſecure their Booty before they returned to the Combat. It happened, that a Horſe the moſt beautiful of all which they had taken, being broken from them, a great many of them followed him with all Speed to take him again, thereupon ſome of them who were already engaged, ſeeing them in that haſt and Precipitation almoſt breathleſs, running in that tumultuous manner, there being nothing ſo diſturbing as a ſuddain Fear, imagined that the greateſt Part of their Enemies having inveſted them, were falling upon their Backs, whileſt that <hi>Saladin</hi> after having cut the Templers in pieces, came to attack them in the Front. This Imagination made them inſtantly face about, and at that Moment ſeeing a great many others following the firſt who cried after the Horſe, they made no doubt but that they fled from their Enemies who purſued them, and thereupon fell to running alſo, thereby drawing by their Example thoſe who were next them, to a ſhameful Flight.</p>
                  <p>It fortuned alſo at the ſame time, that ſome demanding in this Tumult and Confuſion <hi>What is the Matter?</hi> Some others at a Venture made Anſwer that thoſe of the Town having defeated the Guard were plundering the Camp, ſo that this Report being preſently ſpread through the whole Army all disbanded, and ran with Precipitation and diſorder towards the Camp, ſome to ſave that, others to ſave themſelves, all to loſe their Honour and the day, and without doubt all had been loſt, if <hi>Geoffry de Luſignan,</hi> and <hi>James de Aveſnes,</hi> who came out in order of Battle with the Body which they commanded, had not ſtopped the <hi>Turks</hi> who purſued with great Eagerneſs the Flying <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to take alſo their Turn of running, and making the beſt of their Way to their own Camp. Thus ended the unlucky Day, the Honour whereof both parties challenged as their own, and endeavoured as well as they could to frame ſome kind of Appearance of a Victory to themſelves. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for having taken and plundered the Camp of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were alſo finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by them. The <hi>Saraſins</hi> for that they had put the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to Flight, and beaten them to their very Camp. the loſs however certainly fell much more heavily upon the <hi>Saraſins</hi> than upon the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> for the Chriſtians did not loſe above two thouſand Men beſides the great Maſter of the Temple and his Knights, and Count <hi>Andrew de Brienne,</hi> who was ſlain while he endeavoured to ſtop the Flight of his Soldiers. Whereas <hi>Saladin,</hi> beſide incomparably a greater Number of <hi>Turks,</hi> which were ſlain in the firſt Charge, loſt alſo <hi>Miraſalion</hi> his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, his Nephew <hi>Tokedin,</hi> and his Lieutenant General <hi>Migebat,</hi> who were ſlain upon the Place, with the greateſt Part of his Officers, and the moſt Valiant men of his Army, who were aſhamed to fly as did the reſt at the very Beginning of the Battle.</p>
                  <p>After this having mutually taſted of each others Courage, they did as it were by conſent on both ſides forbear fighting, and fell to fortifiing themſelves; <hi>Saladin</hi> in drawing new Troops from all the Places in his Dominions and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by working upon their Retrenchments before the Town, and making Strong Lines of Circumvallation againſt the Army of <hi>Saladin,</hi> Contravallation againſt thoſe of the City whom they Beſieged very ſtraitly by diſtributing their Quarters within the two Lines in this manner: The Marquis of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> took his Poſt toward <hi>Tyre</hi> on the North to the very Coaſt of the Sea; Upon his left were the Knights of the Hoſpital, in a fair Eſtate which they poſſeſſed before the loſs of <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> After them incamped the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> upon a Hill called Mount <hi>Muſard.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> poſſeſſed the quarter between the North and the Eaſt, having at their Head <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Dreux,</hi> with the Biſhop of

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the Diſpoſition of the Chriſtian Camp during all the time of this Siege, which proved very long, for three Reaſons more eſpecially. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had re-inforced his Army with a prodigious number of Souldiers, which repaired to him continually, from all the Provinces of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> attacked the Lines, ſo often as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> attacked the City, and that way made ſo great a diverſion of their Forces, that they never had a ſufficient Force to take it by Aſſault. The ſecond was, that the Garriſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſtrong, and conſiſting in the moſt valiant Men that <hi>Saladin</hi> had, under the Command of <hi>Caracos,</hi> the moſt experienced of all his Captains, and under whom, he himſelf had ſerved his Apprenticeſhip in the Trade of War, they defended themſelves ſo well, and made ſuch furious Sallies, and to ſo good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ruining the Works, burning the Engines, the Towers, and the wooden Caſtles, which were built by the Beſiegers, that after a great deal of Time and Trouble, and the loſs of many of their Men, they were always, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which raiſed ſo much Diſpair in ſome, that quitting the Siege, they returned into the <hi>Weſt;</hi> as among others did the <hi>Lantgrave,</hi> after that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged had burnt a Tower, which with prodigious Labour he had raiſed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the higheſt of the City it ſelf. And without all doubt, this precipitate Retreat, gave occaſion to that falſe and malicious Report, which was ſo much to his Diſhonour, ſpread abroad, That <hi>Saladin</hi> had beaten him home with a golden Sword, and that by ſecret Confederacy, he had ſuffered that formidable Machin to be burnt for want of a ſufficient Defence. But in ſhort, the third and principal Reaſon of the exceſſive length of this Siege was, that both the one and the other received great Succours of Men and Proviſions by Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſtill indeavoured to increaſe their Power. In the beginning the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were abſolute Maſters; for a few days before the Battle, they received a Re-inforcement of ten thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, with all ſorts of Munitions; and in the firſt Year, there came to them above five hundred Ships from <hi>Pavia, Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> who after having diſcharged themſelves of the Men and Proviſions, returned to fetch more. But this Aſſiſtance failing by the Death of <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Fleet which <hi>Saladin</hi> had rigged in <hi>Egypt,</hi> riding Miſtreſs of the Ocean, the Beſieged received all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, and the Beſiegers were ſo miſerably afflicted with a cruel Famine, which conſtrained them to feed on the Carcaſſes of the dead Animals; and which became ſo inſupportable, that a Party of the Army threw themſelves in Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in deſpight of the Wills of their Officers, upon the Enemies Camp, that there they might get ſome Proviſions; and in their Return, falling into an Ambuſcade, were all cut in pieces. However this continued not long, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64918:102"/>it was remedied by the good Conduct of the <hi>Marquis de Montferrat,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> who returning from <hi>Tyre</hi> with his Fleet, which he went to ſit out to Sea, defeated that of <hi>Saladin</hi> in the View of the Town, and revictualed the Camp, which in a little time received a new Reinforcement of excellent Troops, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of young <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and alſo all kind of Proviſions and Arms, which were now with Liberty brought in by Sea. Thus, as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers and Beſieged, were from time to time ſuccoured by the Way of the Sea, they were as it were, by turns, ſometimes Weak and Strong, according as they had the Command of that Paſſage. On the other ſide <hi>Saladin,</hi> who believed always that the beſt way was to cire out the Patience of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> or to famiſh them, would by no means come to a declſive Battle; ſo that Matters ſtood as it were in a continual Balance, neither Party obtaining any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Advantage over the other. But towards the end of the ſecond Year of the Siege, there happened a new Diviſion between the King and the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which indangered the Loſs of all.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Sibyl</hi> and her Daughter being dead by the Incommodities of ſo long a Siege, <hi>Humphrey de Thoron,</hi> the Husband of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the Siſter of the late Queen, who had not the Courage to accept of the Realm when it was offered him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, before the Victories of <hi>Saladin,</hi> had now an Inclination to pretend to it, when it was reduced to the laſt Extremities. <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> although with the Queen his Wife he had loſt all manner of Right, which he held only from her Life, yet proteſted nevertheleſs, that being Choſen, Annointed, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged King, he could not be diveſted of that Auguſt Character, which he was abſolutely reſolved never to quit, but together with his Life. Hereupon the Princes were divided into diverſe Factions: But the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was the moſt powerful and moſt cunning among them, taking the Part firſt of the one and then of the other, with an Intention to remove them both, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured upon their Diviſion to eſtabliſh himſelf both in the Poſſeſſion of the Princeſs and of the Realm. And though the Entepriſe, was both ſurprizing and bold, yet it did not appear to him to be very Difficult; for being Brave, Rich, Liberal, fortunate in War, and of a mighty Reputation, it was eaſy for him to gain a great Party among the Princes, who knew very well there was no Compariſon between him and his two Rivals. For <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could appear in competition of his great Qualities, and <hi>Humphrey de Thoron,</hi> in his Face, his Behaviour, and his Humour, no way Martial, together with mighty Boyiſhneſs, had more of the Air of a young Girl than of a Man: And beſides, the Marquis had a ſecret Underſtanding with the Queen Mother, <hi>Mary</hi> the Niece of the Emperor <hi>Manuel,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Iſabella</hi> her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had no Hatred for his Perſon. Now as they had all taken their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and the Princeſs, cauſed <hi>Humphrey</hi> to be Cited before the Biſhop of <hi>Accon,</hi> the Patriarch <hi>Heraclius</hi> being then ſick to Death; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of <hi>Balian</hi> Lord of <hi>Ybelin,</hi> who had eſpouſed the Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Widow of King <hi>Amauri,</hi> of <hi>Payen</hi> Lord of <hi>Caïphas,</hi> and of <hi>Renaud de Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whom the Marquis had gained; the Marriage was declared Null, upon the Pretence, that the Princeſs had never given her Conſent; but that being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme young, ſhe had been compelled to marry <hi>Humphrey;</hi> and that ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſclaimed it, and proteſted againſt it as an Act of Force and Violence. After which the Marquis publickly Married <hi>Iſabella</hi> by the Miniſtery of the Biſhop of <hi>Beavais;</hi> and carried himſelf as King, to the great Scandal of all good People, who plainly ſaw and deteſted this ſhameful Colluſion, and the horrible Injuſtice which was done to <hi>Humphrey.</hi> It is ſaid alſo, that <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was ſo ſenſibly touched with the Diſpleaſure which he took at this abominable Action, and the Apprehenſion which he had of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Diſorders which were like to inſue thereupon in the Army, that he fell ſick with the Vexation; and in five days died, as Holily as he had lived Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. But the greateſt part adhered to the Marquis, and in regard the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fortune ſeemed to depend upon him, principally for the Proviſions which were to come from <hi>Tyre,</hi> even thoſe who were not at all ſatisfied, yet were obliged to diſſemble their Diſpleaſure; ſo that a patched Accommodation was made, by which the one and the other were to remain in the State wherein they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64918:103"/>were,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> in expectation of the coming up of the Emperor and the two Kings, to whom the Judgment of this Affair was to be committed.</p>
                  <p>In this Condition it was, that the Affairs of this famous Siege ſtood, when News was brought of the Death of the Emperor, and the Arrival of the Duke of <hi>Suabia</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> to whom the Marquis immediately repaired, and conducted him on Board his Fleet to the Camp, where he was received with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Honour; He took his Poſt among the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the Quarter which the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> had before poſſeſſed, upon the Hill of the <hi>Moſquee,</hi> extending to the Bridge of the River <hi>Belus:</hi> So ſoon as this conſiderable Re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement was come, it was reſolved according to the propoſition which was made by Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> to make a general Aſſault: Which was accordingly done both by Sea and Land, with all the Courage imaginable; and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in deſpight of the brave Reſiſtance of the Beſieged, did in more than one place plant the Standards of the Croſs upon the Walls. It was on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it is reported, that <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> made his heroick Courage moſt Conſpicuous, by an Action, whoſe glorious Marks, which at this day bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon the Armes of a Houſe, which is ſince become ſo Auguſt under the Name of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> do eternally publiſh the Memory, Fame, and Glory of it. He fought from the Height of a wooden Caſtle, which was raiſed at the Entry of the Gate againſt the Flye Tower, and which was built upon the Deck of a great Ship. For being mounted over the Walls, followed by a few of his Men, he was ſo hardly preſſed by the numerous <hi>Infidels,</hi> that all his Followers being ſlain, and being now Single, he was conſtrained to throw himſelf into the Sea, half drowned already in his own, and the Blood of his Enemies; for he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Red about him, except the white Scarf which he wore; whereupon <hi>Frederick</hi> to eternize the Memory of ſuch a noble Action, gave him for his Armes, with the great Applauſe of the whole Army, in a Shield Gules a Fez Argent, which the Princes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have ever ſince that time born. The Combat was not much more Advantageous by Land, in regard that <hi>Saladin</hi> having at the ſame time attacked the Lines, which he forced in many places, they were obliged to quit the Aſſault, to repulſe the Enemies, who were at laſt conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. <hi>Saladin</hi> in this Rencounter, loſt the greateſt part of his beſt Men, and did not without great Difficulty diſingage himſelf, being ſomething too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, from thoſe who on every ſide ſurrounded him, and who purſued him a great way beyond the Lines.</p>
                  <p>This was the laſt military Action of Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> who, this being the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Autumn</hi> of the Siege, was by the Diſtemper which raged in the Camp, in a few days taken off, to the incredible Regret of the whole Army, who even adored this brave Prince, whoſe rare Virtue, which ſhined at his Death, had rendred him more Illuſtrious than he had been all the time of his Life, although a thouſand Actions had made it moſt Glorious. For the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Phyſicians aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that his Diſtemper might eaſily be cured by the uſe of Females, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moments Heſitation anſwered, that he had much rather loſe his Life, than preſerve it by ſuch a Remedy as muſt ſully both his Soul and Body, at the ſame time that he had obliged himſelf by the Vow of his Pilgrimage, to do what was pleaſing to Jeſus Chriſt, who is the King, the Crown, and Husband of chaſt and pure Souls, being all Purity and Chaſtity himſelf; and thereupon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered his victorious Spirit into the Hands of God, having overcome the two moſt formidable Enemies of Mankind, the Pleaſures of Life, and the Pains, as well as Fears of Death, of which, in the middle of a flouriſhing and verdant Youth, he choſe to receive the cold Imbraces, rather than thoſe of Life, which he could not ſave but by the loſs of his Chaſtity and Purity. A rare Example, which having been followed ſome three hundred Years after, and in a like Age by Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> Son of <hi>Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter of the Emperor <hi>Albertus,</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> advanced him to that degree of Sanctity, as to deſerve thoſe ſupreme Honours, which the Church ſolemnly renders to thoſe whom ſhe believes to be in the glorious State of the moſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py after Death. But this Death, which was ſo advantageous to <hi>Frederick,</hi> was moſt ſad and pernicious to the Army; for the <hi>Germans</hi> now become deſperate by having loſt both their Emperor and their Prince, would no longer acknowledge
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64918:103"/>any Captain, but quitted that Enterpriſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> which in Concluſion had been ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to them, and returned, as well as they could, into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a few only excepted, who reſolved to Accompliſh their Vow under <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Add to this Accident the Sickneſs which daily continued in the Camp, and the Famine which at ſome times they ſuffered, and by which the Army muſt certainly have periſhed, if the Marquis had not taken Care from time to time to ſupply them abundantly with his Fleet. This abſolutely gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all the Commanders and the Souldiers, who took his Part againſt <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> who now had nothing left, but the vain Shadow of Royal Majeſty, without the leaſt Subſtance of Power or Authority. Thus the Army being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diminiſhed, did nothing now but act upon the Defenſive, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments oppoſing the Aſſaults of <hi>Saladin</hi> on the one ſide, and the Sallies of the Beſieged on the other, till the Arrival of the two Kings, whoſe Voyage and Actions it is now time for me, after having given myſelf and the Reader a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Breath, to recount unto him.</p>

For ſo ſoon as he had received the Sword as Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> at our Ladies Church in <hi>Roan,</hi> and the Crown of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> with the general Applauſe of all his Subjects, who ſaw that he took quite differing Courſes from his Father, who was not at all beloved; he had no other Thoughts, but of making Preparations for the Holy War. Above all things, he applied himſelf to the procuring a good Treaſury of Gold and Silver, but not by charging the People with the rigorous Exaction of <hi>Saladins</hi> Tenth, as did his Father, who when he had received it, made uſe of it in the War between the two Crowns. For this purpoſe he took the way of ſelling all the Dignities which he could, all Offices, and the Lands of his Demeſnes, at a very low rate, thereby to intice the Avarice or the Ambition of unwary Purchaſers, who eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered themſelves to be impoſed upon with thoſe cheap Bargains, not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that he had Deſign of Reaſſumption after his Return, as he did, without any other Reimburſment than by allowing upon the Foot of the Account, what they made over and above their Charges of the Demeſnes, during the time that they injoyed them. But he diſſembled the matter ſo well, and on one ſide ſeemed ſo truly to have a deſign to ſell all that he could, and on the other, ſhewed ſo many Marks of a ruined Conſtitution, which both his conſtant Fatigues of War, and his Debauches gained an eaſy Credit to, that the Purchaſers, without any Difficulty, ſuffered themſelves to be perſwaded that he would never return, and that he had no other Proſpect than of the preſent, as not having any hopes of living long. And for theſe Reaſons it was, that very many ſtraitned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to lay hold of this occaſion of Profit, whereby he drew from them vaſt Summs, turning every thing into Money, even to proteſting to thoſe who were aſtoniſhed at his Proceedings, that if he could find a Chapman, who was able to buy of him the City of <hi>London,</hi> he ſhould make no Difficulty to ſell it to him.</p>
                  <p>But he drew the greateſt Advantages from diverſe Prelates of his Realm that were extraordinary Rich, from whom he drew all the Money that they had, by ſelling to them temporal Dignities, which they were mighty glad to add to their Biſhopricks or their Abbies. It was by this Stratagem, that he drew into
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64918:105"/>the Net the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi>

For that Prelate, who was ready to die with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which he had to be Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> gave him for that Title, all the Riches which he had for a long time been hoarding up, out of the Revenue of his Biſhoprick, as well as thoſe other leſs honeſt Markets which he had made. And to this, he threw in alſo all the Money which he had reſerved, purpoſely to defray his Expences in the Voyage which he had undertaken to make to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> thereby renouncing his Vow, his Conſcience, and his Honour, that ſo he might become great in this World, out of which, his old Age was even now ready to chaſe him, which made the King very pleaſantly to ſay, when he had gotten all his Money, <hi>That he was about to work a kind of Miracle, and to make a young Earl out of an old Biſhop.</hi> He alſo ſeized upon all the Eſtate of <hi>Geoffry Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> for appearing before him with the Train of a King, at the City of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> but all this magnifick Pomp could not prevent the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Death, which ſeized imediately upon him, by this Surpriſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him of this ſtately Vanity, ſo unbecoming the Sacred Character of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. For this Prince believed, that theſe great Riches might to much better Advantage be imployed in defraying the Expences of his Coronation, than ſo fooliſhly laviſhed in the Pageantry of worldly Pomp; and that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſpare his own, which he indeavoured to keep as a Reſerve to ſupport the Charges of his Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> He alſo ſurrendred to <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> for ten thouſand Marks Sterling, the Caſtles of <hi>Rocksborough</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> which he had been conſtrained to yield to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, for his Ranſom, he being taken Priſoner in the War between them. He alſo acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of the Homage which he was obliged by force, to pay as one part of the Price of his Liberty. And in ſhort, as on one hand he was reſolved not to be incumbred with the multitude of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> the Multitudes of which had done more Hurt than Service in the other Expeditions; and on the other, that he knew very well, that diverſe of the richeſt of his Subjects, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves two Years before to undertake that Voyage, were willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be diſpenſed with; he therefore obtained Permiſſion from the Pope, to diſcharge all ſuch from their Vow, upon Condition that they ſhould propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to their Eſtate, contribute a ſumm of Money towards the Charges of the Holy War.</p>
                  <p>All this joyned to the Treaſure of his Father, which he had at firſt ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which amounted to more than nine hundred thouſand Livers in Gold and Silver, gave him the Ability to live after the beſt manner, and in a far more Royal Way than any of his Predeceſſors had ever done. So that he cauſed to be equipped in all the Ports of <hi>England, Normandy, Bretany, Poitou,</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> a great number of Ships, to compoſe one of the faireſt Fleets, which had ever before been put to Sea. For when he weighed from the Road of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where he had paſſed the Winter, he had one hundred and fifty great Ships, fifty three Gallies, beſides Barks, Tartanes, and other ſmall Craft, which attended the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy with Proviſions, and Munitions of War. He gave the Command of the Fleet to <hi>Gerrard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Ouſch,</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to whom he joyned in Commiſſion, <hi>Robert de Sablé, Richard de Chamville,</hi> and <hi>William Fortz,</hi> Earl of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> three excellent Men in Sea Affairs, who had order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſparing any, to put in Execution thoſe admirable Orders, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed for preventing of Diſorders, and Puniſhment of Offences in the Fleet. He could not for all that, ſtop thoſe which were at the ſame time committed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all over <hi>England,</hi> upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> of which himſelf was the Occaſion, tho he did not command it. For as the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom his Father had always favoured, were upon his Coronation Day, contrary to his expreſs Command, entred into the Palace, from whence they were thruſt out, and ſome of them treated very ſeverely, the People, who imagined that it was the King's Inclination that they ſhould exterminate that perfidious Nation, who for their Extortion, Avarice, and other enormous Crimes, were extremely hated, fell upon them with ſuch Fury, that it was impoſſible to appeaſe them: And this Example ſpreading it ſelf, occaſioned a moſt horrible Maſſacre among thoſe miſerable People, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64918:105"/>Cities, where the young People, who had undertaken the Croſs,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>In this time, <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt prepared for this Enterpriſe, in a manner more regular, and did not to procure Money, take thoſe Methods of ſelling Offices and temporal Dignities, to the Prelates of his Realm, who were more regular and modeſt than thoſe of <hi>England:</hi> Neither did he raiſe any Taxes or Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Expences of this Voyage; in regard that all the <hi>French</hi> Lords, who had taken the Croſs, were reſolved to accompliſh their Vow; and he believed that he ſhould have enough out of his good Husbandry, of that Tenth which was given for this War, and which ſtill remained in Bank ever ſince the laſt Year. For this Reaſon therefore he cauſed an Edict to be publiſhed, and all concerned to be ſworn in the Parliament which he held at <hi>Paris,</hi> that they ſhould render themſelves at <hi>Vezelay</hi> in the Week of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> from thence together to take the Voyage. And this being done, he ſent <hi>Rotrou</hi> Earl of <hi>Perche</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to advertiſe King <hi>Richard</hi> of his Proceedings, who on his ſide, made thoſe who had taken the Vow, ſwear the ſame thing upon the Holy Evangeliſts, in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>London.</hi> After which, the King having recommended the Care of the Realm to Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> his Mother, having delivered her from the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the late King had for five or ſix Years laſt kept her, and to <hi>William Longfield</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> his Chancellor, he imbarked the fourteenth day of <hi>December</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> and landed the ſame day at <hi>Graveling,</hi> from whence he went about the end of the Month to Confer with King <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Nonancour;</hi> There it was, that after they had mutually given the one to the other, all the aſſurance of an inviolable Amity, they cauſed Letters, Patents in the Name of both the Kings, to be diſpatched, whereby they fixed the time of their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all their Subjects of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and promiſed to each other a moſt ſincere and indiſſoluble Friendſhip, according to the Faith which they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally plighted to one another; <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as his Friend and faithful Liegeman; and <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> as his Lord and Friend. Theſe are the very Words of theſe Letters dated the thirtieth day of <hi>December</hi> at <hi>Nonancour,</hi> as they are reported by <hi>Radulph</hi> Dean of <hi>London,</hi> who writ in that time ſuch Matters as he himſelf was an Eye Witneſs of, and in the Tranſaction whereof he had a conſiderable Share. But in regard the Time which they had limited appeared too ſhort, for the Preparations which were of neceſſity to be made, the two Kings had a ſecond Interview at <hi>Vezelay,</hi> where they lengthened the time of their Rendezvouz till the Week after <hi>Midſummer.</hi> In which time they finiſhed their Treaty, which among others had theſe Articles; That if either of them died in the time of the Holy War, the other ſhould make uſe of the Money and the Army of the deceaſed King, to carry on and finiſh the War. That the Lords of the two Kingdoms, ſhould maintain a fraternal Correſpondence, and that the Biſhops ſhould excommunicate all thoſe who ſhould enterprize any thing to the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> during their Abſcence. But it happening that about this ſame time Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> loſt her Life, in giving it to two Twins, who did not ſurvive her above three Days, an inauſpicuous Augury was from thence drawn concerning this Voyage; either by the ſuperſtitious Humour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who love to make their fooliſh Remarks upon ſuch Events, and to turn every ſurprizing Accident into a Myſtery of future Conſequences; or poſſibly it might be a kind of Preſage, which God is ſometimes pleaſed to give, as hath been frequenty obſerved, and was more remarkable in another Accident which happened at this very time; For as the King of <hi>England</hi> at the Church of Saint <hi>Martin</hi> in <hi>Tours,</hi> took the Marks of his Pilgrimage to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Pilgrims Staff, by his leaning too hard upon it, broak in the Middle. This Preſage gave a certain Horrour and Fear to all the Aſſiſtants at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but not the leaſt to this immoveable Prince, who was not of an Humour to Philoſophize upon ſuch ſort of Adventures, which gave not the leaſt Trouble or Inquietude to his unſhaken Soul.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> The Devotion of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt was more calm and edifying: He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Day, in the Church of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the conſecrated Pilgrim's Staff, from the Hands of <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> his Uncle by the Mother's ſide; and himſelf took from the Altar, the Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, or the <hi>Oriflame,</hi> with all the moſt ſenſible Marks of a moſt tender and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Devotion; imploring the Aid of Heaven by his Prayers and Tears, in ſuch an uncommon and charming Decency of Piety, as produced the like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in the Souls of all thoſe who aſſiſted at that ſolemn Action. After which, having left the Government of the Realm, in his Abſence, to the Queen <hi>Adela,</hi> his Mother, he came to <hi>Vezelay,</hi> where he was met by King <hi>Richard;</hi> who, to avert the Effects of the unlucky Preſage which happened to him at <hi>Tours,</hi> would there anew receive the Pilgrim's Staff before the Altar of St. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> whoſe Body, they ſay, repoſed in that Abby.

At their parting, they renewed the Proteſtations of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Amity, which they had ſo frequently made, and which, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, were preſently broken at their next Meeting. And truly, it was not reaſonably to be hoped, that it ſhould be of any laſting Continuance between two Princes, whoſe Intereſts, Temperaments, Humours, Sentiments, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Manners accorded ſo very little, as may eaſily be obſerved from the Portraicts and Characters, which I am going to draw from the Life, and the Truth, and to make a Preſent of them to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> was then in the very Flower of his Age, being about twenty four Years of Age, of a moſt admirable Shape, and a Stature ſomething exceeding the Middle, of a Majeſtick Port, and an Air fierce and Martial, which nevertheleſs, had nothing in it diſcouraging the Beholders, in regard it was accompanied with that rare Beauty which Nature had ſo advantageouſly beſtowed upon him; for the whole Turn and Compoſure of his Face was admirable, and all the Stroaks of it regular and delicate; his Forehead was fair and high, his Noſe a little gracefully riſing, his Hair fair, his Cheeks wore a beautiful Vermilion, his Eyes were quick, and ſparkled with a certain gentle Fire, which, with a kind of Fixedneſs in his Looks, joyned with the Colour of his Complexion, manifeſtly ſhewed his Temper to be naturally Sanguin, and inclining to Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and two little Moles which he had growing at the Corner of his left Eye, not at all to the diſadvantage of its Beauty, rather augmented the Whiteneſs of his Skin, by the Oppoſition of their Blackneſs. But that which was the Life of this Royal Beauty, and which added the greateſt Graces to all thoſe Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which ſhined about him with ſuch a charming Glory, was the admirable Qualities of an incomparable Mind, which made all the Vertues neceſſary for a great King ſhine moſt conſpicuouſly in his Conduct, and all his Actions: For he was extreamly Religious, and even jealous for the Glory of God, for which he had Sentiments moſt infinitely tender, and full of a reſpectful Veneration: He was an implacable Enemy to Blaſphemers, whom he cauſed to be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Seine;</hi> and of Hereticks, whom he exterminated with Fire and Faggot: He was a moſt paſſionate Adorer of Equity, Faith and Juſtice, which he cauſed to be rendred to all his Subjects with the greateſt Exactneſs, and without Diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Diſtinction of Perſons, or Partiality; merciful and compaſſionate to the Poor, as if he had been their Father; Liberal, but according to the Rules of Judgment and Diſcretion; Magnificent above the Genius, and the Cuſtom of the Kings of his Age, but moſt particularly in the Expences of his Houſe, and the Entertainment of Military Men, in publick Buildings, and Royal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as well appeared by the ruinous Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he cauſed to be re-built at the ſame time that he was engaged in the Holy War. Upon the whole, he was equally wiſe, prudent and moderate in his Counſels, and quick, ardent and bold in the Execution of them; brave and valiant, even to a Fault; a great Lover of Learning, which he cauſed to re-flouriſh, eſpecially in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris;</hi> affable, vigilant, provident; happy in War, and always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64918:106"/>and victorious,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> as he evidently made appear in his Wars with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and the <hi>Flemmings;</hi> and which, in the Proceſs of his Reign, more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appeared, by the glorious Conqueſts which he made of a great part of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou, Guienne,</hi> and all <hi>Normandy,</hi> of <hi>Avignion, Artois, Cambreſis, Bullen,</hi> and ſo many other Earldoms as he added and re-united to his Crown; beginning, the firſt of our Kings of the third Race, the great Work which <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great hath in our time ſo happily compleated, by giving to <hi>France</hi> the ancient Limits, from the Ocean, to the <hi>Rhine.</hi> In ſhort, if <hi>Philip,</hi> who always triumphed over his Enemies, had had the power to vanquiſh himſelf, and that Impatience and Choler which his hot Temper raiſed in him, and which ſometimes overcame his Reaſon, and for ſome Moments took from him the liberty of acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his better Inclinations, one might ſay, that his Character is that of a Prince accompliſhed with all manner of Perfections which could be wiſhed in a great and admirable King.</p>
                  <p>And it is much to his advantage that he ſtands ſo near King <hi>Richard,</hi> who could not come in compariſon with him, neither for his Body, nor his Soul; although it muſt not be denied, but that Prince alſo poſſeſſed many great and excellent Qualities; but they were mixed with ſo many Faults and Vices, which exceeded his Perfections, that they were obſcured and ſullied by them. He was about the three and thirtieth Year of his Age, of Stature very tall, but of a Shape very diſproportionate, being become exceſſive groſs, either by his Intemperance, or by a Swelling which remained after a long Quartane Ague, which had left his Vifage of a pale, Leaden Colour: His Arms were alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with the longeſt, though very ſtrong and Nervous; and his Thighs too ſhort in Proportion: His Eyes were full of a Fire, but a Fire that was too fierce and ardent: His Hair extraordinary light, and inclining towards Red, which denoted his Complexion to be exceſſively hot and cholerick, and naturally ſtrong, if the Violence of his Exerciſes, his Paſſions, and his Debauches, had not ſo ruined it, as to make it appear almoſt quite overthrown, and wholly languiſhing. It is ſaid alſo, that he had abundance of Cauteries, or Iſſues, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Body, in order to the continual diſcharging of thoſe corrupted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with which he abounded; ſo much had that tedious Ague, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of his Life, altered the Eſtabliſhment and Foundation of his Health, and all the beauteous Lineaments of his Face, which Nature had beſtowed on him. He was however, in the main, a Prince magnanimous, bold, enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, brave, fearleſs, and of an invincible Courage, by which he acquired the Sir-name of <hi>Caeur-de-Lion,</hi> or Lyon's Heart; a Name which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> beſtowed on him, and which the Memory of thoſe noble Actions which he ſo happily and couragiouſly executed, have preſerved to him to this day. It was nevertheleſs eaſily diſcoverable, that he had ſomething of the Fierceneſs and Brutallity of that Animal, mixed with the noble Courage of the Lyon; for it is certain, that he was moſt violent, raſh and turbulent, ſubject to the Tranſports of Fury; hard and ſevere, even to Cruelty, which rendred him odious: Beſides, he was inconſtant, making little Account of his Word and Faith; without a true Senſe of Friendſhip, Tenderneſs, or good Nature, even to the Violation of the moſt ſacred Laws and Rights of Nature, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his frequent taking up Arms againſt his own Father: Above all, He was as eager to draw Money from every thing, as he was prodigal in waſting it when he had it: He was preſumptuous, proud and arrogant; voluptuous and debauched, even in publick, and ſo far from being concerned to conceal them, that he would turn his Crimes into Raillery; witneſs the Anſwer which he gave one day to that holy Man, <hi>Fouques de Neuilly,</hi> who preaching before him in <hi>Normandy,</hi> told him ſeriouſly, that it was time for him to ſet his Affairs in order, and to quit himſelf of three dangerous Daughters which he had, which would certainly prove his Ruin if he kept them any longer with him. <hi>Richard,</hi> who took him according to the literal meaning, thinking that it was very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to convince him of Impoſture; <hi>That is falſe,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>thou Hypocrite, I have no Daughters at all. Pardon me, Sir,</hi> replied the good Man, <hi>you have three very lewd ones; your Arrogance, your Avarice, and your Luxury, which will infallibly, in a little time, ruin you, if you keep them them with you.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> laughing, inſtead of ſeriouſly thinking of Repentance and Amendment; <hi>Since there is a neceſſity then of parting with them, therefore I do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately bequeath my Arrogance to the Templers, my Avarice to the Monks, and my Luxury to the Prelates of my Realm.</hi> But as on the one ſide, notwithſtanding all his Debauches, he had a Principle of Religion which was firmly rooted in his Soul; and on the other ſide, according to his impetuous Nature, he was uſually in the Extreams, either of Good or Bad; he had ſometimes ſuch great Tranſports of Devotion, and was ſo ſenſible of the Enormity of his Crimes, that to witneſs his Repentance, and to ſatisfie God Almighty for his Follies, he would do ſuch things as certainly, the moſt ſevere Directors of Conſcience would never have thought fit to be exacted from ſo great a King. And that which was infinitely advantageous to this Prince was, that this Principle of Religion, ſummoning up all its Power in his Soul at the Hour of his Death, made him expreſs the moſt rigorous Repentance that is poſſible to be found in the Hiſtories of the greateſt Saints. Thus, ſo long as a Man, more eſpecially a Prince, preſerves the Principles of true Faith, by ſubmitting his Sentiments to thoſe of Religion and the Catholick Church, one may ſtill retain a Hope, notwithſtanding the Infirmities to which he is ſubject, that this Root of Life will, in time, produce the Fruits of a true Converſion, and like a Plant which keeps its Root, how dead ſoever it may appear in the Winter, and diſpoiled of its Leaves and Flowers, yet at the Return of the Spring, it will recover its native Beauty, and pleaſant Verdure.</p>
                  <p>Sea now what kind of Men theſe two Kings were, and from ſo vaſt a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Tempers and Inclinations, it will be eaſie to fore-ſee, that they could not remain long in a good Underſtanding, one with the other, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared but too viſibly in the Conſequences of their future Voyage. <hi>Philip,</hi> whoſe Fleet waited for him at <hi>Genoa,</hi> parted the firſt, with a brave and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Army, compoſed of the greateſt part of his Nobility, and the choice Soldiers of <hi>France,</hi> though it is hard to determine preciſely in what number they conſiſted, in regard the Writers of thoſe times have not left us any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Information: But this is moſt certain, that he was accompanied with the greateſt Men of the Realm, the Principal of which were, <hi>Eudes</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, Peter</hi> Count <hi>de Nevers, Renaud</hi> Count <hi>de Chartres, Geoffrey</hi> Count <hi>de Perche, Aubrey de Rullen,</hi> Mareſhal of <hi>France; Matthew de Montmorency,</hi> who was afterwards Conſtable of <hi>France;</hi> the Counts <hi>de Beaumont, Rochefort, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, Dreux de Mello,</hi> Lord <hi>de Loches</hi> and <hi>Chattillon;</hi> and <hi>William de Mello,</hi> his Brother. The Fleet was met at Sea with a furious Tempeſt, which gave the King occaſion to ſhew the Greatneſs of his Soul, in the magnificent Gifts which he beſtowed on choſe who loſt their Equipage, being forced to throw it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, for the Safety of their Lives. At laſt he came to an Anchor, upon the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> in the Road of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where the two Kings had before agreed, the place of their Joyning ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>In this time King <hi>Richard,</hi> after having waited eight days, to no purpoſe, the Arrival of his Fleet at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> being puſhed on by his natural Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, he imbarked himſelf, the 17th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> upon thirty Merchants Ships, which he cauſed to be fitted up; and after having Coaſted all along, by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, Tuſcany</hi> and <hi>Champaign</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> he arrived happily at <hi>Naples;</hi> from whence he paſſed to <hi>Salernum,</hi> there to expect News of his Fleet, whoſe long and unaccountable Delay gave him an extraordinary Inquietude and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet had put to Sea in <hi>Eaſter-Week,</hi> and after it had been ſoundly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a Tempeſt, which, they ſay, was miraculouſly calmed by <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who had raiſed many worſe in his Life, according to the credulous Humour of thoſe Ages; it being affirmed by ſome, that he appeared upon the Deck of the great Ship called the <hi>London,</hi> that Veſſel came up with Cape St. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> over againſt the City of <hi>Silves,</hi> nine other Ships entring the River of <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> where they came to an Anchor.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64918:107"/>that Heaven had ſent him the Succour of theſe Strangers,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> as it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done to the late King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> his Father, requeſted them to help him in this his preſſing Neceſſity. Whereupon five hundred of the braveſt of them immediately went into his Service, whilſt that fourſcore of the moſt valiant young Gentlemen, who were aboard the <hi>London,</hi> put themſelves into <hi>Sylves,</hi> for the Defence of that City: But Fortune, without giving them the liberty of drawing their Swords, put an end to this War, by the ſuddain Death of <hi>Mirmalion;</hi> after which, his Army immediately disbanded it ſelf. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> then returning to their Veſſels, ſound there ſixty three more of their Ships, who had put in there to refreſh themſelves, and all that great City in Arms againſt their People, who had committed great Inſolencies and Diſorders againſt the Inhabitants; inſomuch that Blood had been drawn on both ſides, divers Houſes plundred and burnt, and ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> committed to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But all theſe Matters being calmed by the Prudence of King <hi>Sancho,</hi> who knew very well how to pacifie both Parties, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took their leave, the 25th Day of <hi>July,</hi> and the ſame Day, joyning three and thirty great Ships, with which Admiral <hi>William Fortz</hi> attended them at the Mouth of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> they proſperouſly purſued their Voyage, till they came to an Anchor before <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lernum.</hi> There it was that King <hi>Richard</hi> met his Fleet, and the 30th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> arrived at the Port of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where he was received by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Sicilians</hi> with all poſſible Honour, and with all the Marks of a ſincere and perfect Friendſhip. But this was not of any long Continuance; and the good Underſtanding which at firſt appeared among theſe three Nations, was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted and broken by two great Quarrels which <hi>Richard</hi> had, and which were the Cauſe that the two Kings, inſtead of preſently purſuing their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Voyage, were obliged to defer it till the following Year, and to paſs all the Winter at <hi>Meſſina.</hi> The manner was thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William,</hi> king of <hi>Sicily,</hi> being dead without Iſſue, the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who were reſolved to have a King of the Race of their <hi>Norman</hi> Princes, placed his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Tancred,</hi> the Natural Son of <hi>Roger,</hi> Duke of <hi>Pavia,</hi> upon the Throne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, before his Death, <hi>William</hi> had cauſed Queen <hi>Constance,</hi> his Aunt, the Wife of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> VI. to be acknowledged their Queen, and had declared her to be the Inheretrix of the Crown. Now <hi>Richard,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to have any part in this great Difference between the Emperor and <hi>Tancred,</hi> only deſired of this new King, that he would ſend to him <hi>Jane,</hi> his Siſter, the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>England,</hi> the Widow of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed King <hi>William,</hi> that he would reſtore to him her Dowry, with ſeveral other things, to which he pretended; and above all, an hundred Ships, which the late King had promiſed to his Father-in Law, King <hi>Henry,</hi> for his Voyage to the <hi>Levant. Tancred</hi> immediately ſent the Queen to him, but deferring to give him Satisfaction in his other Pretenſions, <hi>Richard,</hi> who was reſolved that he ſhould do him Reaſon, ſeized upon two ſtrong Places which lay upon the Straits. This gave ſuch a Jealouſie to the <hi>Meſſineſes,</hi> who naturally are not too much given to forbearing, that they took Arms againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and beat them out of the City; and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no leſs naturally impatient of Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but more hot and brave than the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> ran immediately to their Arms, and iſſuing in Battalia, out of their Camp, repulſed theſe forward Burghers into the City, and put themſelves into a Poſture to attack it by Force. There was however, a few Moments Truce agreed to, by the Interpoſition of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, who endeavoured to accommodate this Difference between them. But <hi>Richard,</hi> having diſcovered, or at leaſt believing, that the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> had an Intention to ſurprize him, during the Preliminary Treaty of the Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Aſſault upon the Town with ſo much Fury, that he carried the Place; but he left it again preſently, after he had received the Excuſes of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and the Satisfaction which he demanded of them, out of Reſpect, as he ſaid, to King <hi>Philip,</hi> who had his Quarter in the City, and who was not at all ſatisfied with theſe violent Proceedings of King <hi>Richard.</hi> For this Reaſon <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt him by the Alliance of <hi>Tancred,</hi> concluded a Peace with that King, who offered him, beſides the Ships, twenty thouſand Ounces of Gold, to quit all his other Pretenſions; and twenty thouſand more
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64918:108"/>for the Portion of his Daughter,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> who was to be married to <hi>Arthur,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretany,</hi> Nephew to King <hi>Richard.</hi> So that the Concluſion of this Quarrel was the Foundation of another, incomparably more dangerous, which hereby grew between the kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Tancred</hi> perceiving that the <hi>French</hi> King had no reaſon to be ſatisfied with this Marriage, which was ſurreptitious, concluded without his Knowledge, and which directly ſhocked all his Intereſts, endeavoured to link himſelf more cloſely with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as he did, and to exaſperate them againſt King <hi>Philip.</hi> And truly, finding that theſe two Princes were already imbroiled upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Taking <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where <hi>Richard</hi> having cauſed his Standards to be planted, <hi>Philip</hi> ſent to have them taken down. He went to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſhewed him the Letters, which, he aſſured him, came from the King of <hi>France,</hi> wherein he offered him the Aſſiſtance of all his Forces, if he would make War with <hi>Richard,</hi> who, he ſaid, had no other Thoughts but to amuſe him with the Shew of Peace, thereby with more Eaſe to ſeize upon his Realm. <hi>Richard,</hi> although he was extreamly provoked with this Procedure, yet was very well pleaſed to have ſo ſpecious a Pretence to break with <hi>Philip. Philip</hi> complaining with Juſtice enough, reciprocally againſt him, that having, ſo long ſince, affianced his Siſter <hi>Alice,</hi> he had now altered his Thoughts, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to marry <hi>Berengera,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Garcias,</hi> King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therein the Counſel of Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who her ſelf had conducted that Princeſs thither. There ſeemed great Foundation for the Complaints on either ſide, and their Spirits were wound up to that degree, as indangered the Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy League, by a deadly War between theſe two Princes; which, if it had happened, had abſolutely ruined all the Hopes of ever re-eſtabliſhing the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But, in Concluſion, there were Expedients found out for the appeaſing of this great Quarrel, by an amicable Compoſure, which pacified their Spirits, at leaſt, in Appearance, and for ſome time. <hi>Richard</hi> proteſted that he would moſt inviolably have kept his Promiſe in marrying the Princeſs <hi>Alice,</hi> if he had not been moſt certainly aſſured, for ſome time before, that the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> his Father, who was known to have been moſt paſſionately Amorous of her, had not exceeded the Bounds of Modeſty in his Courtſhip to her; and ſhe, thoſe of Vertue, in the Careſſes which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him: And that, after this Diſcovery, all the Laws, both of God and Nature, oppoſed this Marriage. And whereas the Princeſs pretended her ſelf to be wholly innocent of theſe Crimes, alledging that ſhe had never done any thing Criminal; and that the Appearances of Kindneſs, which ſhe might be accuſed of, in permitting the Viſits of that importunate old King, as ſhe never conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, ſo ſhe was not in the Capacity of hindring them, which poſſibly might be true; yet it was impoſſible to repair the Blemiſh which her Honour had received, and which therefore to him was intollerable becauſe it was incurable; and the malicious World would, to his Diſ-reputation, believe it true, though it might be falſe. He therefore offered to reſtore <hi>Vexin,</hi> which ſhe was to have in Dowry, and to pay her ten thouſand Marks in Silver. And, in ſhort, he paſſed his Royal Word to King <hi>Philip</hi> that, with the beginning of the Spring, he would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without any further delay, to accompany him in the Enterpriſe of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land. Philip</hi> alſo, on his ſide, complained highly, and proteſted that the Letters were ſuppoſitious, and a treacherous Artifice, to engage him in a Quarrel with the King of <hi>England,</hi> his Ally, and Companion in Arms in this Holy War. Thus the two Kings, having once more patched up an Accord, did unprofitably renew the Proteſtations of their Amity, which was impoſſible to hold long between two Princes who had an inſuperable Antipathy the one to the other. However, they paſſed the remainder of the Winter ſomething more calmly at <hi>Meſſina;</hi> where it is ſaid, the famous Abbot <hi>Joachim</hi> foretold the little Succeſs, which they were to expect from their Voyage.</p>
                  <p>This Man who, whilſt he lived, made ſuch a Noiſe and Figure in the World, and who, to this very day, ever ſince his Death, is ſo great a Riddle and Myſtery, was a <hi>Calabrian</hi> by Birth, and an Abbot of the Monaſtery of the <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> in his own Country; his Way of Living, and his Conduct, was wholly extraordinary, and of which never any ſpoke with Mediocrity, whether it were good or evil;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64918:108"/>for ſome would have him paſs for one of the moſt eminent Doctors,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> the moſt famous Prophets, and the greateſt and moſt miraculous Saints that ever was in the Church of God: On the contrary, Others hold him for a moſt impudent Impoſtor, a wicked Hypocrite, and a moſt dangerous <hi>Tritheite</hi> Heretick; for the proudeſt, moſt arrogant, and preſumptuous of Mankind. But thoſe who, without prejudice, have coolly examined all that is alledged on both ſides, touching this famous Abbot, believe that, without doing him Injuſtice, one may keep the middle way between theſe two Extreams, and affirm that he was a bold and ignorant Viſionary, who having a weak Head, and a ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with little Learning, and leſs Solidity of Judgment to manage it, took all his Imaginations, and his own Fancies, for Oracles; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertaking to make Predictions, amidſt a hundred things which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to foretel, he muſt play with very ill Fortune, if ſome of them did not prove true, though it were by the pure Effect of Chance: So that thoſe who had took their Meaſures of him, according to what he had foretold them truly, cried him up as a mighty Prophet; and the others, who had been deceived, as well as he, by his Preſages, treated him as a Cheat, and an Impoſtor: Neither the one nor the other of theſe People, all this while, having the Wit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he was, in reallity, neither Prophet nor Cheat, but a ſilly, over-run Viſionary, who deceived himſelf firſt, and afterwards thoſe who believed him, by his ridiculous Illuſions, which poſſibly was the genuine Effect of his few Brains, and much Preſumption.</p>
                  <p>And for certain, this is true, that going to viſit the holy Places at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> at the Age of fifteen Years, when he hardly underſtood his Grammar, he pretended that the Spirit of God was infuſed into him, in the Church of the holy Sepulchre; and there a perfect Knowledge of all the hidden Myſteries of the Scripture was beſtowed upon him, eſpecially of the Book of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> whereof he ſaid he had the Key, which no Man before him could ever find. That thereupon, without applying himſelf to any other Studies, he began to labour with the Viſions of that Book, which he endeavoured to adjuſt to his own, as beſt pleaſed him; taking his own Dreams for the true Senſe of thoſe ſacred Myſteries. However, he was ſo ingenuous as to acknowledge, that he neither had any Revelations, nor yet the Gift of Prophecy; but that he had received from God the Spirit of Underſtanding, as clearly to underſtand what was contained in the Prophecies of the Old and New Teſtament, as the Prophets themſelves, who writ them by the Impulſe of the Spirit of God. Moreover, he was a Man who affected Singularity, and who aimed at nothing but was very uncommon and extraordinary, both in his Conduct and his Doctrine; and that therefore, in the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. he was declared an open Heretick, becauſe he had undertaken to write, and maintain, againſt the Great Maſter of the Sentences, ſome Poſitions concerning the Trinity, which was open <hi>Tritheiſm;</hi> for he was of Opinion, that every Perſon in the Holy Trinity had a diſtinct, Proper and peculiar Eſſence, and that they were begotten, one from another. He was alſo preſented in the Pope's Court, and accuſed by the Religious of his own Order, among whom he raiſed a moſt dangerous Schiſm. In ſhort, He was an eternal Medler with Prophecies, Predictions, and the Affection of foretelling future Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: And if ſome one of his Preſages, by mere Chance, proved true in the Event, there were a hundred of them, ſo obſcure and ambiguous, that might be interpreted either way; many of the moſt famous of thoſe which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with ſo much Noiſe and Confidence, being proved falſe in their Events, even whilſt he was alive; which cannot be made appear better, than by this famous Conference which he had at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> with King <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there being a mighty Talk of this Abbot <hi>Joachim,</hi> who was at this time in the Top of his Reputation, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> where all People heard him as a Prophet, <hi>Richard</hi> deſired <hi>Tancred</hi> to ſend for him to <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that from him he might be informed of the Succeſs of this War which he was about to undertake, to re-conquer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the Hands of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> This is commonly the nature of Men, eſpecially of Great Men, to have a longing deſire to penetrate into the inſcrutable Secrets of the time
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64918:109"/>to come,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> by a dangerous and vain Curioſity, which uſurping upon the peculiar Prerogative of God Almighty, who hath reſerved this Knowledge incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicably to himſelf, he does not fail to puniſh that bold Preſumption, by ſome Misfortune, either agreeable or contrary to the Prediction which is made. But that which gave <hi>Richard</hi> the greater deſire to conſult this famous Abbot was, the ſad News of the deplorable Accident which had befallen the Emperor, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him out of the World in the middle of his victorious Courſe, and which, it was confidently reported, had been predicted to him moſt clearly by the Abbot, who poſitively affirmed, that he ſhould have no good Succeſs. This gave a mighty Confirmation to all thoſe People who had conceived this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, that he had the Gift of Prophecy. Come he did then, and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his cuſtom, taking upon him the Tone of a Prophet, he preſently told the two Kings, with a ſerious Air, and without a Moments Heſitation, <hi>That it was to no manner of purpoſe that they were going to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to deliver the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>in regard that the Time appointed for its Deliverance was not yet come. Philip</hi> the Auguſt, who had a moſt ſolid Mind, and who took no further care but to give good Order for the preſent, thereby to aſſure the future, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the beſt Art of Prediction, was in no pain for this Diſcourſe of the Abbot, to which he gave but little Credit. But <hi>Richard,</hi> who had a certain Weakneſs for thoſe kind of Prophecies, had a Curioſity to be further ſatisfied, demanded of him, upon what kind of Knowledge he founded this Prediction, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with ſuch Aſſurance. Whereupon this Viſionary, whoſe Head was full of nothing but the Chimera's of his own Dreams, which he made upon the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> of which he thought he had as perfect an Underſtanding as St. <hi>John,</hi> who writ theſe Revelations, fell to interpreting the Viſions contained in that Book, and eſpecially that of the horrible Dragon with ſeven Heads, which would have devoured the Man-child which was to be born of the Woman cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sun. The ſixth Head of this Monſter, he ſaid, was <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had taken <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who ſhould certainly be deſtroyed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſhould regain this holy City; but that, according to the Myſtery of the Numbers denoted in the Viſion, it ſhould not be till ſeven Years, from the Taking of it, were accompliſhed. <hi>If it be ſo,</hi> briskly replied <hi>Richard,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>What have we done, to come ſo far to no purpoſe? Your Voyage,</hi> anſwered the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, <hi>was neceſſary for your own Glory; for that by doing this, God will make you triumph over all your Enemies, and will elevate you above all other Princes of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Events plainly ſhewed, that theſe two firſt Predictions were moſt falſe, ſince <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not taken in that time, and that the Voyage was, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, very unfortunate for King <hi>Richard,</hi> who fell into the Hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and was very ill treated by them.</p>
                  <p>But his Illuſion, or rather, his Extravagance and Folly appeared much more, when, purſuing the Interpretation of this Myſtery, according to the diſorderly Capricioes of his own Imagination, he added, that the ſeventh Head of this Dragon was Antichriſt, who ſhould be born in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhould be Pope: for this dangerous Devote had the Confidence to publiſh this Folly, and boldly to affirm, that this Enemy of Jeſus Chriſt was, at that time, in his youthful Age. That in the Year 1199. the ſixth Seal of the fatal Book ſhould be opened, and that thereupon ſhould enſue the Kingdom, Perſecution, and the Death of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and that the Goſpel ſhould, before that, be preached in all the World. But he might very well, himſelf, before his own Death, ſee the falſeneſs of his Prediction. And from that time that he undertook, with ſo much Confidence, to maintain that Opinion, he was moſt powerfully confuted, and convinced of the little probability of his Prophecies, by the Archbiſhops of <hi>Ouſch</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Bayonne</hi> and <hi>D'Eureux,</hi> and other learned Eccleſiaſticks, who were preſent at this Conference; and ſhewed him by Scripture, which plainly tells us, that the Time which he undertook to limit, was wholly unknown; that his Conceptions were not only falſe, but raſh and vain Imaginations of his own Fancy, which he endeavoured to obtrude upon the World for Truths. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that King <hi>Richard</hi> himſelf, who now undertook to be able to confute him, made no more Account of him than King <hi>Philip</hi> had done, and no further amuſed himſelf about him. See what manner of Man this Abbot <hi>Joachim</hi> was,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64918:109"/>and what Belief he gained upon the Minds of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> who were not altogether ſo credulous as the <hi>Italians,</hi> many of which, though, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; but only, among the Common People, his Fictions paſſed Currant, as if they had been Heavenly Oracles. But it is obſervable, that this hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been the Deſtiny of thoſe who would undertake to propheſie, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain future Events, by accommodating them to the Myſteries of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> to loſe the greateſt part of their Reaſon and Underſtanding, by daſhing againſt that Rock which hath ſplit ſo many Spirits as, by their fooliſh Curioſity, have, at laſt, only gained the infamous Reputation of being Viſionary Extravagants.</p>
                  <p>The two Kings therefore, without being retarded by the Predictions of this Man, whom they ſent back to his Solitude of <hi>Haute-Pierre</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> to write upon the Prophets and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> reſolved to purſue their Voyage ſo ſoon as the Seaſon would permit. <hi>Philip,</hi> who always preſſed the King of <hi>England,</hi> not to delay the time, parted the firſt, in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> with all his Fleet, and arrived fortunately, in two and twenty days, upon <hi>Eaſter-Eve,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Acre,</hi> where he was received by the <hi>Cruſades</hi> with incredible Tranſports of Pleaſure, as if an Angel from Heaven was come to the Relief of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, which had now beſieged this important Place very near three Years. So ſoon as he was arrived, he viſited the Works, and took his Quarters ſo near the Walls, that his Lodgment was within leſs than a Diſcharge of the Darts and Arrows of his Enemies. He then began to plant his Slings for great Stones, his Rams, and other Engines, which played to ſo good purpoſe, and ſo furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the place, that in few days he had made a reaſonable fair Breach. At which time the <hi>French</hi> preſented themſelves before it, in order to an Aſſault, reſolved to periſh, or to carry the Place, and all the Honour of the Siege. And no doubt can be made, but the City had certainly, that day, been taken, conſidering the mighty Earneſtneſs which ſo many brave Men ſhewed, ſo freſh, and ſo reſolute, if King <hi>Philip,</hi> who always acted with great ſincerity, had not been ſomething too ſcrupulous upon this Occaſion, even to the diſadvantage of the publick Intereſt. For whereas one of the Articles of the Treaty which he had made with the King of <hi>England</hi> imported, that they ſhould equally ſhare their Conqueſts, he underſtood this Article to extend even to Glory, and was reſolved that <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould ſhare it with him in the Taking of the Town, which he was in a Condition to take without him. And therefore, contenting himſelf with lodging at the Foot of the Wall, he reſolved to put off the Aſſault till his Arrival.</p>
                  <p>And in truth, that Prince was reſolved to put to Sea immediately after <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> but he was conſtrained to defer it ſome time, by reaſon that Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> his Mother, who brought along with her the Princeſs <hi>Berengera,</hi> arrived the ſame day that <hi>Philip</hi> ſailed. He cauſed theſe two Princeſſes to be magnificently received at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where he affianced this new Miſtriſs; after which, Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> returning for <hi>England,</hi> taking with her <hi>Jane,</hi> his Siſter, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Berengera,</hi> he commanded part of his Fleet to attend them, and himſelf, with the reſt, darted at laſt, upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in <hi>Paſſion-Week,</hi> from <hi>Meſſina,</hi> eighteen days after King <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt. It is true, the Sea was not at all propitious to him, for, upon <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> he was met by a moſt furious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; but having, till this time been ever mighty fortunate, he drew a great Advantage from this Accident, and the Tempeſt which ſcattered his Navy, was worth to him the Conqueſt of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> The manner whereof I will in ſhort recount.</p>
                  <p>The Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> one of the faireſt and greateſt of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, lying about ſome hundred Miles from <hi>Syria,</hi> was at that time under the Dominion of the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who ſent thither ſome Duke, or Lieutenant, to be their Deputy-Governor. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Prince of the Houſe of the <hi>Comnenius</hi>'s by his Mother, who was Daughter of another <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Brother to the Emperor <hi>Manuel,</hi> had ſeized upon that Government, during the Empire of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> by virtue of Letters Patents from that Emperor, which this Cheat had counterfeited; and not long after, he very openly uſurped the abſolute Dominion of the Place, by taking upon him the Title and Authorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. After the Death of the unfortunate <hi>Andronicus,</hi> he maintained himſelf in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64918:110"/>his Uſurpation,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> againſt all the Forces of <hi>Iſaacius Angelus,</hi> whom he defeated, with the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Margeritus,</hi> Admiral of the Fleet of <hi>William,</hi> King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi> After which, as this Tyrant, who was one of the moſt wicked of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſaw himſelf aſſured in his new Empire, according to the cuſtom and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Tyranny, which is, indifferently to commit all manner of Crimes, to enjoy the firſt, which is committed by revolting from a lawful Maſter, there was no manner of Wickedneſs, Injuſtice, Robbery, Extortion, Violence, or Cruelty, which he did not exerciſe upon the poor Iſlanders, whom he reduced even to the utmoſt Diſpair. Nor had he much more Humanity towards Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; for three great Ships of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which, by the Violence of the Tempeſt, had been thrown upon the Iſland, and ſtranded, in the View of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſo,</hi> anciently called <hi>Amathus,</hi> upon the South ſide of the Iſland, this <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> who preſently run, with his Soldiers, to the Bank, cauſed all thoſe who eſcaped the Wrack to be taken, and after having inhumanely deſpoiled them of all they had about them, and in their Ships, he cauſed them to be bound, Hand and Foot, and thrown into a deep Dungeon, there miſerably to periſh by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Nor would he permit the great Ship, on Board of which were the two Princeſſes, and which was in manifeſt danger of being loſt, to come within the Port of <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> as they had earneſtly deſired Permiſſion of him to do; but would have them ride it out, expoſed to the Mercy of the Seas and the Waves, that ſo he might have the brutiſh and cruel Pleaſure, either to ſee them ſink to the Bottom, or ſplit againſt the Rocks.</p>
                  <p>In this time, the Tempeſt being appeaſed, <hi>Richard,</hi> who had taken Port at <hi>Candia,</hi> and from thence had ſailed to the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where he re-aſſembled his Ships; and hearing of the ill Treatment which ſome of his Ships had met with in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he came and preſented himſelf, with the reſt of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, in good Order, before <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> the 6th Day of <hi>May,</hi> and immediately ſent to the Tyrant, to demand Satisfaction for the Affront had been done him, with a peremptory Command to him, inſtantly to ſet ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at Liberty as he had made Priſoners, and to make full Reſtitution of whatever he had taken from them. The furious Brute fiercely replied to the Envoys of the King, <hi>That they ſhould go tell their Maſter, that he was ſo far from giving him the Satisfaction he fooliſhly demanded, that if he did not make the more haſte, and take the advantage of his Sails and Oars, he muſt expect the ſame Treatment for himſelf.</hi> And thereupon he marched directly to the Shoar with all the Troops which he kept in Pay, and a multitude of confuſed, undiſciplined People, ill armed, and worſe ordered, who ran down in hopes of Booty, and not in expectation of Blows: But he was mightily miſtaken in the Man with whom he was to deal, for <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> furiouſly exaſperated by his Anſwer, gave preſent Order that all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould make a Deſcent, by the help of the Barks and Chaloups; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf into the firſt Row of the Barks, at the Head of his Archers, he rained ſuch a Storm of mortal Arrows, as he rowed to the Shoar, upon the Heads of his affrighted Enemies, that under the favour of that Conſternation, he leaped firſt aſhoar, and was followed ſo courageouſly by his Men, who ſound none to oppoſe their Deſcent, that they charged ſo briskly upon theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with their Swords in their Hands, and fell into the Battalions of theſe cowardly and diſorderly <hi>Greeks,</hi> they preſently put them into Confuſion, and in a few Minutes, to a manifeſt Flight, and in the Purſuit, made a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Slaughter among them, till they got to the Mountains, where they ſaved themſelves: Then returning, the victorious Army entred <hi>Limiſſo</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, the Soldiers, who were to have kept it, having, for fear, abandoned the place.</p>
                  <p>This happy Beginning was preſently ſucceeded by a Concluſion no leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; for the Night following he ſurprized <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who, having rallied his People, came to encamp within five Miles of <hi>Limiſſo;</hi> and having cut the beſt part of his Troops in pieces, diſſipated the reſt, and taken all his Baggage: So that this miſerable Wretch, abandoned of the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> who, the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Victory, came to do Homage to King <hi>Richard,</hi> was conſtrained, in moſt humble manner, to beg a Peace; which he obtained upon Conditions hard enough, and ſufficiently ignominious, and ſuch as, poſſibly, King <hi>Richard</hi> would
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64918:110"/>not have required of him; but his Cowardly Fear dictated them to him:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> And he who, in his Proſperity, was ſo preſumptuous, to imagine he could not offer too little; in this Reverſe of his Fortune, thought he could never offer enough. The Conditions were theſe; <hi>That he ſhould own the King of</hi> England <hi>for his Soveraign, and ſhould do him Homage for the Iſland, under the Title of the Realm of</hi> Cyprus. <hi>That he ſhould give his only Daughter and Heireſs to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver King</hi> Richard <hi>ſhould nominate. That, beſides delivering the Priſoners which he had taken, he ſhould pay twenty thouſand Marks in Gold, for Dammages to thoſe whom he had plundred. That he ſhould go in Perſon, with twenty thouſand choice Men, to ſerve the King in the War of the</hi> Holy Land. <hi>That, for the Security of his Promiſes, he ſhould inſtantly put all the Places in his Dominions into the King's Hands: and that, reciprocally, the King ſhould engage upon his Honour to reſtore them to him, ſo ſoon as he had accompliſhed all his Engagements.</hi> And, to begin with what was moſt ſhameful, he immediately came to do his Homage to King <hi>Richard,</hi> in the Preſence of <hi>Guy,</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan,</hi> his Brother, <hi>Raymond,</hi> Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Bohemond,</hi> Count of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> his Son, <hi>Aufrey de Thoren,</hi> and the other Lords, who were come to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to oblige King <hi>Richard</hi> to enter into their Intereſts, againſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> whoſe Party King <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt ſeemed much to favour.</p>
                  <p>But this Peace did not laſt long; for, whether this unfortunate Tyrant was aſhamed of his Cowardice, or that ſome Perſon had advertiſed him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that there was a deſign to make him a Priſoner, he fled the ſame Day, and made it be told to the King, That he was reſolved never to keep ſuch an unjuſt Treaty; which being the Effect of Force, and the ſuddain Diſorder of his Judgment, by Diſpair, was not at all obliging. For this Reaſon <hi>Richard,</hi> who was better pleaſed with War than Peace, which, how advantageous ſoever, raviſhed from him a Conqueſt which he could not fail of obtaining, inſtantly cauſed him to be purſued both by Land and Sea, with ſo much Heat and Expedition, that, running over the whole Iſland, with his Troops divided into ſeveral Parties, all the Cities opened their Gates to him, ſo ſoon as he or his Lieutenants appeared before them. So that the miſerable <hi>Iſaac,</hi> abandoned of all the World, who had him in Deteſtation, even in his better Fortune, was conſtrained to ſurrender. The Princeſs, his Daughter, who was in the Caſtle of <hi>Cherin,</hi> was the firſt to implore the Clemency of the King; who received her with great Civility, and cauſed her to be conducted to <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> where was the Queen, his Siſter, and the Princeſs <hi>Berengera.</hi> After which, the Tyrant, who had now no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat left, beſides a Monaſtery fortified upon a Rock, ſeeing that he was about to be attacked, could not reſolve to die honourably, in making a noble Defence, but, by extream Lowneſs of Spirit, reſolved to beg a Life, which ought to have been more inſupportable than a thouſand Deaths. He came then from the Monaſtery in the Habit of a Mourner, his Hair and Beard neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, his Eyes overflown with Tears, throwing himſelf, like a Slave, at the Feet of the King; and he, who had ſo audaciouſly aſſumed the Title of an Emperor, ſubmitted himſelf entirely to his Mercy, only making his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that he would not put him in Chains; which, of all the things of the World, he ſaid, was what he moſt feared, and which would, aſſuredly, make him die with Grief. Whereupon, King <hi>Richard,</hi> who naturally loved to divert himſelf with the moſt ſerious things, and who was ſo far from being touched with any Compaſſion for the Miſery of this <hi>Infamous,</hi> that, in regard of his woful Cowardice, he had ſcarcely the Patience to ſee him; turning himſelf to <hi>Raoul,</hi> his Chamberlain, to whoſe Charge he conſigned this miſerable Man, and ſmiling, he commanded him to uſe him as an Emperor, and that therefore he ſhould put upon him Manacles, Fetters and Chains of Silver, to diſtinguiſh him to be a Priſoner of Quality: Which <hi>Raoul</hi> did not fail, ſolemnly to put accordingly in Execution.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Realm of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was, without any conſiderable Loſs, conquered in leſs than three Weeks by King <hi>Richard,</hi> who, at the ſame time, married the Princeſs <hi>Berengera</hi> at <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> and cauſed her to be Crowned Queen of

This done, he ſent the two Queens and the Princeſs, the Daughter of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with a good Party of his Fleet, who arrived happily at <hi>Acre,</hi> the 1ſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> being the Eve of <hi>Whitſunday.</hi> He cauſed the Tyrant to be conducted Priſoner to <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> and, for himſelf, after he had regulated the Affairs of his new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he put under the Conduct of two Governors, he received from his new Subjects the Value of half their Moveables, which they offered him of their own Accord, that ſo they might have from him the Confirmation of the Privileges which they had formerly enjoyed under the Emperor <hi>Manuel.</hi> All which Matters being adjuſted, upon the 5th of <hi>June,</hi> he parted from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> with the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Levantine</hi> Princes: The next day he paſſed before <hi>Tyre,</hi> where the Garriſon of <hi>Conrade,</hi> fearing he might ſeize upon the Place, would not permit him to Land. The next Day, as he drew near to <hi>Acre,</hi> he diſcovered the biggeſt of all the Ships that he had ever ſeen upon the Sea, who had the Arms of <hi>France</hi> painted upon her Stem; but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it might be ſome Stratagem, and ſending out to hall her, he found it was a Ship of <hi>Saladin</hi>'s, which had on Board her five hundred choice Men, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Arms and Munition; as alſo, Artificial Fire-works, and two hundred moſt venemous Serpents, in Glaſſes, to throw into the Camp of the <hi>Chriſtians. Richard</hi> cauſed her to be attacked by his Galliots; and, after a long and furious Combat, which was maintained with extraordinary Obſtinacy by thoſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate People, till ſuch time as being pierced in a great many places by the Stems of the Galliots, who ran upon her with full Sails and Oars, that ſhe ſunk to the Bottom, all the Soldiers and Mariners, who threw themſelves into the Sea, or into the Ships of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to ſave themſelves, being either drowned or ſlain, excepting two hundred of the principal Officers and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, who were taken Priſoners. After which, <hi>Richard,</hi> landing the next day, being the 8th of <hi>June,</hi> entred, as it were, in Triumph, laden with Spoils and Glory, into the Camp before <hi>Acre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt received him with the greateſt Demonſtrations of Joy and Friendſhip. But that Prince, too generous, learnt quickly after, by a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Experiment, that an Exceſs of Vertue, which cauſes one to loſe a fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, eſpecially in Matters of War, is always a great Fault in a Prince or Captain. And certainly, he ought not to have made any Scruple of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the City, as he might eaſily have done, without King <hi>Richard,</hi> whom he unprofitably ſtaid for ſo long time, while that King, more cunning, and leſs ſcrupulous, and who had not for others ſuch tender Concerns, did, without him, take a whole Kingdom. For, in ſhort, the miſſing of this Opportunity gave Riſe to many Accidents, which had like to have entirely ruined the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: For the Beſieged made great advantage of that long Repoſe, and the leiſure which was given them by a kind of Truce, of which they knew not the Cauſe; however, they employed it to the repairing of the Breaches, and were ſo ſtrengthned by little Succours, which frequently ſlip'd into them, that they found themſelves in a Condition often to repulſe the great Aſſaults which were given againſt them at unſeaſonable times, the Opportunity being loſt before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the King of <hi>France</hi> firſt, and after ſome time, the King of <hi>England,</hi> fell ſick of that dangerous Malady, which made them loſe their Hair, Nails and Skin, by its ſubtil and Corroſive Malignity, which conſumes all that Matter which is neceſſary for the Defence or the Ornament of the Body. But the moſt dangerous Evil of all, and which endangered the common Ruin, was, the Diviſion which broke out more furiouſly than ever between the two Kings. The ancient <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Hiſtorians of that time lay all the Blame upon <hi>Philip,</hi> whilſt the <hi>French,</hi> who writ at the ſame time, accuſe King <hi>Richard,</hi> and lay all the Fault at his Door: and the reaſon is plain, that both the one and the other living at the ſame time, and writing what was done in their own time, either their Fear or their Hope, their Love or Hate, took from them the power and the liberty of writing the Truth ſincerely, and without Partiality. For my own particular, who, beſides the natural Love I have for it, have always made Profeſſion to ſpeak and write, when there is occaſion, with that frank and honeſt liberty which can never be taken from a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64918:111"/>good Man,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> and who am under no manner of Temptations from any of theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which may hinder me from ſpeaking concerning theſe Kings what I believe to be true, it cannot be ſuppoſed I ſhould do otherwiſe, ſince I have nothing either to hope or fear from them; and that there is no danger, four hundred Years after their Death, any Perſon ſhould ſo warmly eſpouſe the Intereſts of their Aſhes. I ſay then, that after having ſtrictly examined whatever is written upon one ſide and the other, concerning this great difference, I find, that <hi>Richard</hi> did not uſe King <hi>Philip</hi> with that Reſpect which was due to him, as his Liege Lord for ſo many great and fair Provinces as he held of him in <hi>France:</hi> For as he had amaſſed prodigious Sums of Money in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he ſpared no Coſt to allure the braveſt Men to his Party, and to draw them to his Service by exceſſive Profuſions, and the extraordinary Advantages which he made them; inſomuch that, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Philip</hi> gave three Crowns in Gold by the Month to every Horſe-man, he promiſed four to ſuch as would quit that Service, and take Pay under him. So that he ſeemed to endeavour to exhalt himſelf above his Maſter, and to render him contemptible. But then, on the other ſide, <hi>Philip,</hi> who had a great Heart, and who bore it very impatiently, to be in this manner inſulted over by his Vaſſal, ſhewed ſo much diſpleaſure, that he gave thoſe whom the Profuſions of <hi>Richard</hi> had gained, eſpecially the <hi>Levantines,</hi> who were moſt charmed with them, occaſion to believe that he was not able to ſupport his Greatneſs, and his Merit, to be thus topped and overſhaded. Moreover, as <hi>Philip,</hi> before the Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had ſo far advanced the Works, and ſo beaten down the Walls, and ruined the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, that he might eaſily have taken the place, if he had not been too ſcrupulous of taking all the Glory to himſelf; whereas <hi>Richard,</hi> to whom he had given the opportunity of taking his ſhare, by a ſtrange Effect of Jealouſie and Ambition, would by no means have the City taken whilſt <hi>Philip</hi> was there; inſomuch, that when the <hi>French</hi> aſſaulted the Town, this jealous Prince prohibited the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> either to ſuſtain them, or to aſſault it on their ſide, as had before been reſolved upon at the Council of War. This brought on Reproaches, Quarrels and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, which daily increaſed, and grew more violent between the two Nations, than that of the War which had begun to break out before, under King <hi>Henry;</hi> there being, beſides, naturally not too much Sympathy between them.</p>
                  <p>That which augmented this Diviſion was alſo the Difference between <hi>Guy de Luſignan</hi> and the Marquis <hi>Conrade de Montferrat,</hi> for the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which the one pretended to keep, and the other to have, when as <hi>Saladin</hi> was yet poſſeſſed of it: For King <hi>Philip</hi> carried himſelf openly for the Marquis, in the Right of his Wife; and for that being a great Warrier, who had, by his good Conduct, preſerved the ſmall Remainder of that poor Realm, it ſeemed much better that he ſhould have it, rather than his Rival, who had loſt it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, for want of Courage, and ſufficient Conduct. On the contrary, the King of <hi>England,</hi> for that very reaſon, oppoſed his Pretenſions, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhould fall into the hands of ſo brave a Man; and therefore, with all his Power, he ſupported <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> by reaſon that that unfortunate Prince having much Weakneſs, and little Merit, <hi>Richard</hi> was in hopes of diſpoſing of the Realm according to his own Will. And, in ſhort, the new Conqueſt which the King of <hi>England</hi> had made of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he was reſolved to keep, did not at all pleaſe <hi>Philip,</hi> who demanded the half of that Realm, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Treaty, by which they were obliged to divide equally between them whatſoever ſhould be gained by that Voyage. But <hi>Richard</hi> maintained, either that this Diviſion was to be reſtrained to ſuch Conqueſts as were made upon the <hi>Infidels,</hi> or otherwiſe, that by the ſame reaſon he ought to divide the Succeſſion to the Earldom of <hi>Flanders</hi> with the King, ſince, by the Death of the Earl, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> pretended to have acquired a Right unto. And by reaſon of this Diviſion, their Spirits were ſo exaſperated, that while nothing was done againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, both ſides reproached each other with holding a ſecret Intelligence and Correſpondency with the <hi>Infidels,</hi> both the one Party and the other receiving Preſents from <hi>Saladin.</hi> And, in truth, this brave <hi>Saraſin</hi> Prince, who was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally generous, and made War like a noble Enemy, was uſed, from time to time, to ſend the moſt excellent Fruits of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to the two Kings, who, in Return, ſent him ſome of the pretty Rarities of <hi>Europe.</hi>

That they ſhould devide between them whatſoever they ſhould take from the</hi> Infidels. <hi>That when one of the two Kings ſhould give an Aſſault to the City, the other ſhould oppoſe</hi> Saladin <hi>in defending the Lines; and for the difference between</hi> Guy de Luſignan <hi>and the Marquis</hi> de Montferrat, <hi>it ſhould be referred to the Determination of certain Judges equally choſen on both ſides.</hi> And not long after a ſolemn Judgement was rendred thereupon by which it was decreed, <hi>That</hi> Guy de Luſignan <hi>ſhould for the remainder of his Life continue</hi> King of Jeruſalem, <hi>but that his Children if he ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again ſhould have no ſort of Pretentions to that Crown, the Reverſion and Succeſſion whereof ſhould remain to the Marquis and thoſe Children he ſhould have by the Princeſs</hi> Iſabella <hi>his Lady, Siſter to the late Queen</hi> Sybilla. <hi>That in the Interim he ſhould have the Moity of the Revenues of the Realm, together with the Principalities of</hi> Tyre, <hi>of</hi> Sydon, <hi>and</hi> Baruth, <hi>by holding them of the Crown; and that</hi> Geoffry de Luſignan <hi>ſhould upon the ſame Conditions hold the Counties of</hi> Jaffa <hi>and</hi> Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea.</p>
                  <p>This being done, and the Peace in this manner confirmed at leaſt in Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance between the two Kings, nothing was now thought upon but how to preſs forward the Siege; and it was done with ſo much Vigor, by continual battering the Walls both Night and Day and redoubling the Attacks, that the Beſieged <hi>Saraſins</hi> now diſpairing to be able long to defend the Place againſt ſo great Forces, as were now become unanimous, offered to ſurrender, provided they might be aſſured of their Lives and Liberty to retire whither they pleaſed, without carrying any thing away with them more than their wearing Apparel, The Kings, who were aſſured they could carry the Place, thought to make a conſiderable Advantage of that diſpair to which ſo many Brave men were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whom they believed <hi>Saladin</hi> would not ſuffer to periſh, and therefore would hearken to no Terms, unleſs <hi>Saladin</hi> would reſtore the true Croſs, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Cities which he had taken after the Battle of <hi>Tyberias. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin,</hi> who was obliged to turn his Arms againſt the Son of <hi>Noradin,</hi> who attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take from him <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> was willing to conſent to theſe very Terms, provided that the Kings ſhould aſſiſt him againſt his Enemies in Perſon with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Men; nay he was contented that it ſhould be done by their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and with fewer Troops, to which he would join his, provided, they would ſerve him one Year. But whether the two Kings judged it unworthy of their Majeſty, which they thought muſt ſuffer an Abaſement in ſerving an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,;</hi> or that the Son of <hi>Noradin</hi> on the other ſide ſolliciting them to joyn with him againſt <hi>Saladin,</hi> They believed that by ſuch a favourable diverſion they ſhould be able with Eaſe to take from him all thoſe Cities, they abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed theſe Conditions. And therefore they began now more furiouſly than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to attack the City, in one of which Aſſaults, <hi>Alberic Clement Mareſchal</hi> of

                  <p>The City being taken, the Kings according to their Treaty divided all the Booty equally between them, as alſo the Priſoners and the Houſes.

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> and were ready to force the Place, and that the Beſieged found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neceſſitated to capitulate, before the ſurrender, <hi>Leopold,</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who attacked a quarter on the oppoſite part had ſeized upon another Tower, and had there planted his Standard, which ſtood there after the Reduction of the City. <hi>Richard,</hi> who for other Matters was exaſperated againſt <hi>Leopold,</hi> in regard that as well as the reſt of the <hi>Germans</hi> he had been of <hi>Philip</hi>'s. Party, took this occaſion to be revenged of him, as if he had uſurped upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the two Kings, and therefore cauſed the Standard to be taken down by plain Force, and being torn in pieces and trampled under Foot he cauſed it to be thrown into the Kennel, by the moſt inſupportable of all Affronts that could be given to a Prince who loved Glory. The <hi>Germans</hi> who were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally jealous of the Honor of their Nation, and incapable of bearing, I do not ſay, ſuch a horrible Injury as this was, but even the Shadow of being contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had not failed inſtantly to do themſelves reaſon by their Arms, which they preſently took againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but <hi>Leopold</hi> who was altogether as brave, but ſomething a better Diſſembler than King <hi>Richard,</hi> choſe rather for a time to reſpite his Vengeance, which he hoped to find a more fit occaſion for, where he ſhould not be blamed by induring the pain of this Affront for doing greater Miſchiefs to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Affairs, which muſt needs ſuffer much by a Civil War, and which in a few days following did ſuffer extremely by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruel Effect of the Violent Nature of this Prince. For ſeeing that <hi>Saladin</hi> perſiſted in refuſing to ſatisfie the Articles of the Capitulation, which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged had on his Behalf ratified, he conceived ſuch a Deſpight, that he Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly cauſed the Heads of above five thouſand Priſoners which fell to his Share, to be cut off. Nor could he be diſwaded from it, by the Conſideration of ſo many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captives, to whom <hi>Saladin</hi> as he had menaced cauſed the ſame meaſure to be given, by a kind of cruel Repriſal, the blame of which is always laid upon him who begins. And certainly it hath always been ſeen, that theſe dangerous Examples, which are given to an Enemy in the time of War, which he always believes he hath a Right to render the like meaſure, for the Security of his own People, have always been condemned by others who have had the Occaſion to ſuffer by it, and that thoſe who give it are at laſt conſtrained to abſtain the firſt from it, though ſomething with the lateſt, and after it hath cauſed the Lives of ſo many unfortunates, as have periſhed either by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the one or the Vengeance of the other. As for King <hi>Philip</hi> who was more moderate, he uſed his with more humanity and contented himſelf to leave the Priſoners in the Hands of Marquis <hi>Conrade,</hi> as he Paſſed by <hi>Tyre</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Holy Land</hi> into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince who was extreme Wiſe, perceived on the one hand that <hi>Richard,</hi> become now more Fierce and Violent than ever, after the taking of <hi>Acre,</hi> kept no ſort of Meaſures, and that it was impoſſible for them long time to keep in any Terms of Accord; and on the other, perceiving that he was daily infeebled by the Diſtemper into which he was again relapſed; he might run the Hazard of dying in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> without being able to do any Service to <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and that in the mean time Advantage might be taken of his Abſence, by invading the Earldom of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which ought to return to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by the Death of Count <hi>Philip.</hi> He made this to be moſt civilly repreſented to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that finding by the increaſe of his Diſtemper, he was like to be rendred incapable to ſerve the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he judged it more to their Advantage, that one ſingle Commander ſhould finiſh the War; and for this purpoſe, that he would reſign all wholly to his Conduct, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a good party of his Army, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi> He added alſo, that to take from him all manner of Pretext which he might have to complain of his Departure, or the Fear that he might entertain, that he did not return into <hi>France,</hi> but to fall upon his Dominions there during his Abſence, he aſſured him, that if he had occaſion to make War upon him, it ſhould not be till the Expiration of fourty days after his Return. After which, having left five hundred Men at Armes, and ten thouſand Foot, with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and ſome Troops which he lent for a Year to the Prince of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:64918:113"/>he imbarcked the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> upon thirty Gallies,

From thence, paſſing by Land into <hi>France,</hi> in the Month of <hi>December</hi> he arrived at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and from thence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> where proſtrating himſelf before the Altar of the Holy Martyrs, he offered his Royal Robe, and gave ſolemn Thanks to Almighty God, who had delivered him from ſo many Dangers as he had run by Sea and Land, and had at laſt happily reconducted him into his own Kingdom. This was the Concluſion of this holy Enterpriſe of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and as one may ſay abſolutely, that it was very Fortunate, by the Reduction of the City of <hi>Acre;</hi> ſo it is moſt certain, that it had been much greater, if it had been performed by his ſingle Forces; for being compoſed of the very Flower of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>France,</hi> and conducted by the moſt Wiſe and Valiant King of that time, they might without Difficulty have Triumphed over <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> if the Conjunction of a moſt potent Rival had not infeebled them by than unhappy Diviſion which his haughty, jealous, and ambitious Humour occaſioned among them. But in ſhort, this is generally the Fatality which accompanies ſuch kind of Unions, which being made among differing States and Princes for ſome common End, uſually by the growing of Diſcords among themſelves, terminate in the intire Ruin of thoſe united Sentiments and Deſigns; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſo Improſperous, eſpecially in the Affairs of War, as want of a good Underſtanding and Concord among Confederates, which in reallity is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if ever, to be expected from the multitude of Coordinate Captains, which muſt needs produce Differences and Oppoſitions firſt in point of Opinion, and afterwards by neceſſary Conſequence, in the very Union it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But in this time King <hi>Richard,</hi> who was now the ſole Commander of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> proved not much more Fortunate in the end of his Enterpriſe, by reaſon that he was ſo continually agitated by the Tempeſts of his own violent and tumultuous Paſſions, that he was difficultly at any Agreement with himſelf, but was become even his own Rival: For on the one hand, his Ambition, and love of Glory, mingled with ſome Remains of Piety and Religion, tranſported him vigorouſly towards the puſhing forward his Conqueſts againſt <hi>Saladin,</hi> and above all, to take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was the main End of this <hi>Cruſade;</hi> on the other, the Jealouſie of State, and the Fear of the Armes of <hi>Philip,</hi> whom in his Conſcience, he knew to be moſt juſtly Exaſperated againſt him, the Diſtruſt which he had of the <hi>French</hi> which were left behind, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the great Friend of the Marquis the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> his mortal Enemy, and above all, his Avarice, which was his ruling Paſſion, and the Covetouſneſs of drawing immenſe ſumms of Money from the <hi>Saraſin</hi> Nobility, whom he detained Priſoners, and from <hi>Saladin</hi> himſelf, who continualy ſollicited him for a Peace; all theſe Paſſions put him into great Diſcompoſures of Mind, and he was under very ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of making ſome Truce with the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and paſſing immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe.</hi> But it muſt be ſaid to the Glory of this King, who doubtleſs was one of the braveſt of his Age, that at length his moſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>He employed ſome ſix Weeks in repairing the Breaches of <hi>Acre,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing his Army, which after the Retreat of Marquis <hi>Conrade,</hi> and almoſt all the <hi>Italians,</hi> and many other <hi>Cruſades,</hi> whom either Poverty or Wearineſs, or Diſcontent, cauſed to forſake this lingring War, yet conſiſted in above one hundred thouſand Men. After which, towards the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move, and took the right hand along the Sea Coaſt, to ſelve upon ſuch maritim Places as <hi>Saladin</hi> had cauſed to be diſmantled. The Fleet conſtantly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64918:114"/>plyed along the Coaſt with them,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1190</label> to furniſh them with Proviſions, but he had alſo on his left hand the Army of <hi>Saladin,</hi> who coaſted along the Mountains, to moleſt him by continual Skirmiſhes in his March, and to watch ſome favourable Opportunity to give him Battle upon any notable Advantage; and upon the ſeventh of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Infidel</hi> thought he had found the lucky Moment at the Paſs of a River, which diſchargeth it ſelf into the Sea near <hi>Antipatris.</hi> For <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had above three hundred thouſand Men in his Army, had divided them into three Bodies, one of which was poſted on this ſide the River, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Paſſage of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> another was ranged on the further Bank, to the intent that if the firſt Body ſhould be broaken, they might be ready to charge ſuch as ſhould attempt to paſs the River; <hi>Saladin</hi> himſelf with the third, which was by much the greateſt, and compoſed of the choiceſt of all his Troops, kept himſelf in the Coverture of the Mountains on the left of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, ready to fall upon the Rereguard, at ſuch time as the Van ſhould be ingaged with his other Troops in diſputing the Paſs of the River.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard,</hi> who had ſtayed ſome days at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> as well to refreſh his Army, as to repair the Ruines of that Place, no ſooner came within View of the River, but that he ſaw it on both ſides imbanked with his Enemies, he reſolved therefore to give them Battle; both in regard there was no ſtopping to looſe the Paſs, nor no retreating without manifeſt Danger of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and put into ſome Diſorder by retireing. Now as he marched always in Battalia, for fear of being ſurprized, his Army was inſtantly drawn into ſuch Order as was convenient. The Valiant <hi>James d' Aveſnes</hi> that day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Van, with what remained of the <hi>Danes, Brabanters, Flemings,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The King led the Body of the Battle, where were the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Normans,</hi> the <hi>Poiteuins,</hi> the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> and the <hi>Levantine</hi> Troops; near his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the Young <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Champagne,</hi> his Nephew, who to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of what he owed to King <hi>Philip</hi> his Soveraign, who was alſo his Uncle; this young Prince being born of the Siſter of the King, the Daughter of Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young, was intirely devoted to King <hi>Richard.</hi> The Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Army, who was accompanied by the Templers and the <hi>German</hi> Troops, who followed <hi>Leopold</hi> the Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who never abandoned the <hi>French,</hi> but were moſt ſtrictly united with them during this <hi>Cruſade.</hi> So ſoon as the Armies came within View, which was about Noon, the Combat was not long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; For <hi>James d' Aveſnes,</hi> who was one of the braveſt and moſt prudent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of his Age, charged ſo furiouſly upon the firſt Squadrons of the Enemies, who were poſted on this ſide the River, that he broak into them twice, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning and killing all that oppoſed his Paſſage: But being tranſported with the heat of his Courage, as he returned to the third Charge, followed but by a few, in compariſon of that fearful Number of thoſe who ſucceeded in the place of the broaken Squadrons, he received a terrible Blow with a Scymiter, which cut off his Leg; notwithſtanding which he ſuſtained himſelf by the force of his invincible Courage, and failed not ſtill to fight and to Slay on the right and the left, all ſuch as durſt venture within the reach of his dreadful Sword, till at laſt, that alſo with the Sword fell by another unfortunate Blow of the Scymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereupon thoſe cowardly <hi>Infidels</hi> fell upon him, and by a thouſand Wounds gave him a glorious Death, after he had opened the Way to Victory by that Carnage which he had made of the moſt daring of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and by the Flight of the more Cowardly.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Richard,</hi> who ſuſtained him, and who heard him a moment before his Death, cry out aloud, <hi>Brave King, come and revenge my Death,</hi> all in Fury at his Fall, entred at the Breach which this illuſtrious Deceaſed had made, and fell in like a Thunderclap among the thickeſt of the Enemies, where the <hi>Flemings,</hi> mad even to diſpair to have loſt their General, already made a dreadful Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among them, that unable to ſtand the dreadful Shock, they turned their Backs, and ſled amain towards the Mountains to ſave themſelves. So that the Bank being on this ſide cleared of the Enemies, this valiant Prince, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the couragious Engliſh leave to cool one Moment, threw himſelf into the River, which at this time was but very low, and drawing by his Example, all

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards that great Body of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who pretended to defend the other Bank. This he did with ſo much Reſolution, that they had not the Conſidence to expect him, but inſtantly diſperſed themſelves and ſled, the King not offering to put himſelf to the trouble to purſue them; ſo that finding himſelf Maſter of both the Banks of the River, where no Enemy appeared, he believed he was in perfect Poſſeſſion of a compleat Victory, when he found himſelf miſtaken, and perceived at a great Diſtance on the other ſide of the River, a prodigious Cloud of Duſt, mingled with Darts and Arrows, which might be ſeen ſly from all Quarters, as alſo one might hear a confuſed noiſe of the Inſtruments of War, the cryes of Men, and the neighing of Horſes: This was occaſioned by the greateſt part of the Army of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> commanded by <hi>Saladin</hi> himſelf, who deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Mountains into the Plain, had ſurrounded the Arrere-guard, which he believed was at too great a diſtance to be ſecured by the main Battle: For <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin,</hi> who was a great Captain, had cut them off ſo much to his Advantage, and had them ſo in the plain Field, that he promiſed himſelf an aſſured Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and doubted not but he ſhould certainly either cut them in pieces, or force them to ſurrender at Deſcretion. But he quickly found that he had to do with People who were Maſters in the Trade of War, who having without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ranged themſelves into four Battalions, ſuſtained on the right and left by what Cavalry they had, formed the Face of a Battle every way, and with little Loſs ſuſtained all the Efforts of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who believed themſelves already Conquerours, till ſuch time as <hi>Richard</hi> advertiſed of the Danger of theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Men, quickly repaſſing the River, came running at full Speed to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Then it was, that for ſome time the Combat began to be more ſurious and bloody than it was before, the two Kings by their Voice and Geſture, but much more by their Example, animating their Souldiers to aſpire to Victory. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having done all that could be expected from two of the moſt able Captains in the World, Providing againſt all Events, giving out neceſſary Orders, and themſelves in the Charge giving the the firſt Blows, it happened that in the Rencounter, knowing each other by thoſe Marks which diſtinguiſhed them from the reſt, they both hit upon the ſame thought, and each of them believing he had ſound an Enemy worthy of himſelf, and whom with honour he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, both as a Souldier and a King; they both believed that the general Victory would depend upon their particular Encounter, and that he whom Fortune ſhould declare her Favourite, would not fail of having the Glory of ſingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Victory. So both of them, at the ſame time, charging his Arm with a ſtrong Lance, they furiouſly ran one againſt the other, and being both of them moſt Stout and Valiant Men, admirably mounted, and animated with an ardent deſire of Glory, wherein Hatred had the leaſt Share, the Shock was extreme Rude and Violent, their Lances flew into a thouſand Splinters, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was ſomething diſordered with the mighty Blow which he received, but he had managed his Lance with ſo much Adreſs and Force, that he overthrew both Horſe and Man upon the Ground: This raiſed a mighty Shout from both the Armies, as if <hi>Saladin</hi> had been ſlain; and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> came tumbling in Shoals about him, ſo thick, either to relieve him if alive, or to carry him off if he were dead, that <hi>Richard,</hi> who was approaching with his Sword, advanced to finiſh his Victory, was conſtrained to let it fall upon leſs conſiderable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of whom he made a moſt horrible Slaughter, for their interpoſing betwixt him and Glory. <hi>Saladin,</hi> the goodneſs of whoſe Armes had ſaved his Life, ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed in Body, and tormented with the Shame of his Fall, being mounted upon a freſh Horſe, did by his ſpeedy Flight prevent a worſe Deſtiny, and left the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in poſſeſſion of a cheap and perfect Victory. For ſeeing that a great part of his Men, frightned by the Belief they had that he was ſlain, had already found their Heels, and that the reſt being altogether in Confuſion and Diſorder, retreated before the Enemy, he thought now no longer of any thing but how to ſave himſelf, and after him the whole Army thought it no Diſgrace to make the beſt haſt they could from Death and Danger, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them cloſely at the Heels. Thus the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army remained Victorious
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64918:115"/>on all ſides,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> and with ſo great a loſs of the Enemies, that what in the Battle, and what in the Purſuit, above fourſcore thouſand of them were ſlain, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them thirty two Emirs were found among the Dead on the Field of the Battle; ſo great a Victory coſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but a very few private Soldiers, and not one Man of Condition, except the valiant <hi>James d' Aveſne,</hi> who was ſlain at the beginning of the Battle of the Vanguard.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt be ſaid, that if King <hi>Richard</hi> knew how to vanquiſh in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Day, with all the Glory which can be gained upon a like Occaſion, he had <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s Misfortune, not to have the Art to make Advantage of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For if inſtead of amuſing himſelf with Rebuilding the Maritim Towns, which <hi>Saladin</hi> had ruined, which might have been more commodiouſly done at another Seaſon, he had marched ſtraight to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> moſt aſſuredly he might have taken it without Reſiſtance, by reaſon that <hi>Saladin</hi> was fled among the Mountains, and thoſe who were left there for the Defence of the Place, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to hope to be Relieved, and fearing to meet with the ſame Meaſure, which thoſe who had ſo obſtinately defended <hi>Acre,</hi> would ſcarcely have had the Courage to defend it againſt him. But whether it were his Proſperity, and the exceſſive Joy, with which ſo great a Victory had diſturbed his Mind, which made him incline to taſt the Pleaſure of being ſo great a Conqueror, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were, that after having done very well, one naturally loves to take the more eaſy part, and not to hazard that Glory which one hath already acquired; certain it is, that this is a Fault with which almoſt in all Ages, one hath occaſion to reproach the greateſt Captains; and it is obſervable, that moſt frequently they have loſt the Opportunity of finiſhing a War, by attacking, after great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the Enemy, and following the fortunate Blow which they had given. Thus King <hi>Richard,</hi> after ſo fair a Victory, loſt the reſt of the Year in re-building and re-peopling the Maritim Towns, and eſpecially <hi>Jaffa,</hi> whither he cauſed the two Queens to come; and where in that time he ran a far greater Danger than he he had done in beſieging of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Day as he was hunting, he with five or ſix of his Gentlemen, fell into a great Ambuſcade of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> where he had been infalibly taken and lead Captive to <hi>Saladin,</hi> if one of the Lords who accompanied him, whoſe Name was <hi>William de Pourcellets,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Provence,</hi> who was wholly devoted to his Service, had not done an Action which Hiſtory ought to recommend to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as a moſt illuſtrious Example of that inviolable Fidelity which Servants owe to their Maſters, and much more Subjects to their Soveraigns, though to the hazard of their Lives: For ſeeing the King, who valiantly defended himſelf with mighty Blows of his Sword, in danger to be taken, or ſlain, as already four of the Company were, who lay extended upon the Graſs at their Maſters Feet, he cried out in the Language of the <hi>Saraſins, I am the King:</hi> Whereupon, all of them deſirous to have a ſhare in the taking of ſo great a King, ran to him, and gave King <hi>Richard</hi> the liberty to ſave himſelf, whileſt without regarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, they all fell with Precipitation upon him whom they took for the King. <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had nothing of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> in his Conduct, acting like a generous Prince, treated his Priſoner according to the merit of ſo brave an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And King <hi>Richard</hi> for his part, failed not to recompence him with Honours proportionable to his Deſerts, for he gave in Exchange for him ten of the greateſt and richeſt Noblemen among his Priſoners, to manifeſt the Eſteem which he had for this brave Man, whom alone he valued at the rate of ten Princes, for whoſe Ranſoms he might have expected very great Riches and Treaſures. This was the Glory, which by his Virtue, this gallant Man acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for himſelf whileſt living, and which dying he bequeathed to his illuſtrious Houſe, which to this day preſerves its Luſtre, and maintains its Rank among the moſt Ancient and the moſt Noble of <hi>Provence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this time <hi>Saladin</hi> ceaſed not to lay all the Country Waſt, and thereby to take away all manner of Subſiſtence from the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> as alſo to ruine all the Cities of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> except <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and two or three ſtrong Fortreſſes; whileſt <hi>Richard</hi> unprofitably waſted his time in rebuilding thoſe Places, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, could give no trouble to his principal Deſign. He alſo ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be amuſed by a Treaty of Peace, extremely Advantageous to him, which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64918:115"/>
                     <hi>Saphadin</hi> the Brother of <hi>Saladin</hi> pretended to negotiate between them,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> by which he propoſed to the King to relinquiſh to him all the Country on this ſide <hi>Jordan</hi> to the Sea, provided that <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> which was to be demoliſhed, ſhould apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to neither Party. Theſe Offers ſeemed ſo Advantageous to <hi>Richard</hi> who was already imbroiled with the <hi>French</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that he was very much diſpoſed to conclude with <hi>Saphadin.</hi> But at length he perceived that he was deluded, and that the <hi>Barbarian,</hi> more cunning than honeſt, had not begun this Negotiation but to gain time, and to throw him upon the Winter. He thereupon fell into an extreme Rage, and as Rage is one of the worſt of Councellors, which puts Men upon acting without any certain Rules or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to ſatisfy this inpetuous Paſſion, he blindly followed its Conduct, and at that unſeaſonable time of the Year undertook the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which if he had conſulted Reaſon, he ought to have done, and might happily have effected it, three or four Months before.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1192</label> He went therefore with Precipitation enough in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> with the whole Army, already much diminiſhed by the departure of many of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were diſpleaſed with his Delays of Peopling, Planting, and Rebuilding, in which he conſumed the Summer, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Rama,</hi> which <hi>Saphadin</hi> in his Retreat had demoliſhed, he advanced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three or four Leagues of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All the Souldiers witneſſed an exceſſive Joy, to find themſelves within View of that City, where they hoped ſhortly to worſhip before the Sacred Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo great an Aſſurance had they of the Victory. But when the Counſel was aſſembled, the Paſſion of King <hi>Richard</hi> being ſomething cooled, and the Matter debated in cold Blood, the greateſt part of the Captains adjudged that the Enterpriſe was too raſh to hope that it ſhould Proſper. There it was remonſtrated, <hi>That the Town was very Strong, and well provided, that</hi> Saladin <hi>was there in Perſon with the choiceſt of his Troops, not at all doubting but that there he was in a Condition of Security, as Affairs then ſtood, the Seaſon being ſuch, that an Army could not poſſibly undertake a Siege, without putting themſelves, againſt all the Rules of Art and War, into a moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Danger of being Ruined; That in effect, the Country being intirely ruined by the Waſt, which</hi> Saladin <hi>had made, there was not Subſiſtence to be found for one ſingle day for the Army; and that it being in the deep of Winter, there was no probability of getting Proviſion by the Sea. And for that extraordinary Ardor which the Soldiers ſhewed, it ought to be ſuſpected, by reaſon that one might well fear, that ſo ſoon as they had viſited the Holy Sepulchre, they would quit</hi> Paleſtine <hi>to return into their reſpective Countries, aand abandon the new Conqueſts to the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>who would then eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what had been taken from them.</hi> And for theſe Reaſons, <hi>It was concluded to defer the Siege till the Spring ſhould be advanced, and in the mean time to continue the Fortification of the places which had been Demoliſhed, and above all, the City of</hi> Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>which was infinitely Commodious, for hindring the Succours which might come to the Enemy out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and to receive ſuch as might arrive for the Aſſiſtance of the</hi> Cruſades <hi>out of</hi> Europe.</p>
                  <p>This Reſolution was no ſooner taken than it was put in Execution, though with an unconceivable Diſpleaſure to the Souldiers, and above all to the <hi>French,</hi> who openly murmured againſt <hi>Richard,</hi> whom they did not ſtick to accuſe of having a ſecret Underſtanding with <hi>Saladin.</hi> They ſaid boldly, That <hi>Saladin</hi> had never ſhut himſelf within the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if he had not been very well aſſured that he had nothing to fear from ſuch an obliging Enemy. And that without all queſtion, he was ready, had the Army but once faced it, to quit the Place, and that the Garriſon would either quickly have followed him, or have Surrendred, fearing to be abandoned by him, like thoſe who ſo bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Acre,</hi> to the Deſcretion and Mercy of the Vanquiſher. But however it were, ſo ſoon as the Army came to <hi>Rama,</hi> a great part of it disbanded, the moſt of the <hi>French</hi> retiring to <hi>Jaffa, Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Acre;</hi> but this did not hinder King <hi>Richard</hi> to purſue the Reſolution which had been taken, to go and fortify <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> whither he went acompanied with the Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> his Nephew, who continued always conſtantly faithful to him. The Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> alſo went thither with him, but it was not long before they left him; the <hi>Auſtrian,</hi> becauſe he was afreſh unworthily, as he thought, treated by him,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64918:116"/>for refuſing to take one part of the Town to Fortify,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1192</label> which cauſed him, with all his <hi>Germans,</hi> to retire into his own Country; the <hi>Burgundian,</hi> becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſired him to lend him ſome Money for the payment of his Troops, he briskly refuſed him in Terms very diſobliging, which cauſed the Duke, who before had no great Kindneſs for King <hi>Richard,</hi> to carry away the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Acre;</hi> in a little time after which, there happened an Accident which occaſioned a mighty Change in the Face of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Piſans</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> to whom Quarters were aſſigned in that City, and who had for a long time quarrelled each other, came at laſt to open Hoſtilities, and in the Fray had committed great Slaughters one upon the other. The <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who had always joyned with the <hi>French,</hi> in taking part with the Marquis <hi>Conrade,</hi> called him in to their Aſſiſtance; but the King of <hi>England,</hi> to whoſe Service the <hi>Piſans</hi> were devoted, came ſo expeditiouſly with his Army to their Succour, that <hi>Conrade,</hi> who was already incamped before the Town, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf too weak to make any Reſiſtance, was conſtrained to draw off again to <hi>Tyre.</hi> And within a few days after, about the end of <hi>April,</hi> as the Marquis returned from the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> who had treated him at a Dinner, he was ſlain in the open Street by two <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> of the <hi>Old Man of the Mountain:</hi> The Prince ſo called was Lord of a little Eſtate ſituated in the Mountains of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> between <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>Tripolis,</hi> which conſiſted in ten Caſtles, built upon moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible Rocks, and in ſome few Towns, which ſtood in the moſt fair and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Valleys which lay among theſe Mountains. Theſe People, who from a <hi>Perſian</hi> Word were called <hi>Aſſiſſins</hi> or <hi>Capyciens,</hi> conſiſted in about ſixty thouſand Souls, who came from the Confines of <hi>Perſia</hi> near <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſome four or five hundred Years before, about ſuch time as the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the Succeſſors of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> rendred themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and having poſſeſſed themſelves of theſe Mountains, whoſe Avenues they had rendred inacceſſible, they had ſo well fortified them, that till this very time they had maintained their Liberty independent from either the Caliphs, the Sultans, or the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Their Prince was Elective, who took no other Name but that of the <hi>Ancient,</hi> or the <hi>Old Man,</hi> as a Mark not of his Age, but of his Authority and Power.</p>
                  <p>And indeed that was ſo great, and he was ſo obeyed by his Subjects, that there was no manner of Danger to which they did not freely expoſe themſelves in the Execution of his Commands, tho the moſt unjuſt and barbarous in the World, even to throwing themſelves headlong from any Precipice, upon the leaſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that ſuch was his Pleaſure. So much power had this falſe Belief upon their Spirit, which they had by Tradition received from their Anceſtors, and in which they took great Care to Educate their Children, that by dying in this manner, in Executing without Exception or Difference, what was commanded them by the <hi>Ancient,</hi> they ſhould paſs imediately to the injoyment of a Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Happy in the Heavens. So that when he ſent them to the Court of any Prince, either <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Saraſin,</hi> who had diſobliged him, with a Command to diſpatch him, there was no ſort of Diſguiſe or Artifice, no manner of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which they would not make uſe of, to perform his execrable Commands, without ever flinching at the moſt cruel Torments, which they might expect to Suffer; and in the midſt of which, they would manifeſt a certain Pleaſure, that they had with Fidelity acquitted themſelves of their Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly very ſtrange, that the Princes who had ſo much Intereſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſuch a pernicious Nation, ſhould ſo long time permit them, not only to have a Being, but looking upon them as it were, as Maſters of their Lives, by the Fear which they had of theſe <hi>Aſſaſſins,</hi> they made them continual Preſents, thereby to gain their Favour to permit them to live. For never any except the Templers, were ſo bold as once to offer to attack them; but they valiantly ſet upon them, entred their Country, and obliged them to pay the yearly Tribute of two thouſand Crowns, to ſecure their Villages from being Plundred; but in this Proſperity of their Armes, they did an Action ſo Baſe and Wicked, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly drew upon them the Hatred and the Curſe of God and Men. For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of <hi>Amauri</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Old Man of the Mountain,</hi> who was a Man of Senſe, having compared the Goſpel with the Alcoran, ſent to let that King Underſtand, that he with all his People, were ready to embrace
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64918:116"/>the Chriſtian Religion, provided that at the ſame time,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1192</label> that he was received into the Liberty of the Children of God by Baptiſm, he might alſo be freed from that Tribute which he was conſtrained to pay to the Templers. The King, who offered to make the Templers an Equivalent to the loſs they might hereby ſuſtain, made no doubt, but that they would with Joy receive a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſo advantageous to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but eſpecially to Princes, who had always reaſon to fear all things from theſe Deſperadoes; but Avarice, which had already begun to corrupt that Order,, ſo far blinded them, that one of the Knights, upon whom the great Maſter would never permit Juſtice to be done, aſſaſſinated the Ambaſſadour, who was come to propoſe a Condition ſo juſt and reaſonable. This ſo exaſperated theſe People, that they became more obſtinate in their <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> more Enemies to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and more <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> than ever they had been before.</p>
                  <p>It was for ſuch a kind of Injuſtice that theſe two Ruſſians murdered the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>Conrade,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> for a ſhip loaden with rich Merchandiſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a Subject of the <hi>Old man of the Mountain</hi> being forced by a Tempeſt to put into the Port of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the Marquis cauſed her to be ſeized, and put the Maſter of her to death for complaining of the Injuſtice which was done him. The Prince of the <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> ſending to demand Satisfaction and Reſtitution of the Ship and Goods, and Reparation for the Death of his Subject the Marquis made a laughing matter of it at the firſt, but upon a Second demand, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of the Envoys, to be thrown into the Sea. This ſo incenſed the old man, that he ſent two of his Devotes to <hi>Tyre,</hi> who there counterfeited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> and got themſelves baptized the better to cover and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to execute their Treaſon; After ſome time they found means to get into the Marquis his Retinue, and ordinarily to attend him wherever he went; and hereby obtained an Opportunity of ſtabbing him as he returned from Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais;</hi> and though they were put to the moſt exquiſite Torments which could be ſuffered, and roaſted alive, yet would they never accuſe any Perſon, or confeſs who it was that ſet them on to commit ſuch a horrible Murther. There were ſome however who failed not to ſuſpect King <hi>Richard,</hi> who was known to be his declared Enemy, and the report was ſo ſtrong that it was written to King <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and he was aſſured that this Prince with whom he had had ſuch great differences, had hired the <hi>Old man of the Mountain</hi> to commit this Aſſaſſinate upon the Marquis.</p>
                  <p>There cannot indeed be too much Precaution to preſerve the Sacred Perſons of Kings upon which depends the Welfare of their Dominions; and upon this occaſion, <hi>Philip</hi> took Guards about his Perſon, to protect himſelf from a like Treaſon, and ſuch damnable Attempts. But neither Hiſtory nor Hiſtorian ought ſo far to take the particular part either of Princes or Nations, as to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf of that Duty which he owes to truth; and for the Intereſt I have in that, I think my ſelf obliged toſay, That though King <hi>Richard</hi> neither lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved King <hi>Philip</hi> nor the Marquis yet nevertheleſs he was, not at all culpable of theſe horrid Crimes of which ſome have with ſo much Injuſtice and ſo little Truth accuſed him, and endeavoured to blacken his Memory. And indeed the <hi>Prince of the Mountains</hi> did in a ſhort time after wholly juſtiſie and acquit him of this ſuſpicion, by the Teſtimony of his Authentick Letters, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the true cauſe of this Murther of the Marquis, according to the manner which I have before recounted. And one ought with Truth to avow, that conſidering the Natural Humour and Inclination of King <hi>Richard,</hi> he could not be capable of ſo black a Treaſon; for although he was extreme Violent, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous and mighty Impatient of Injuries and Affronts, yet he had a great and generous Soul, and made Profeſſion openly and like a Gallant man to attack ſuch as he believed he ought to eſteem his Enemies, and was never known to have recourſe to baſe and Ignominous Ways of taking his Revenge. And this great Courage not only taught him to deſpiſe all theſe falſe Reports, but alſo to draw all thoſe advantages which an able Polititian could make of ſuch an untoward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, in the baſeneſs whereof he knew he had no ſhare. For he managed the matter ſo well, that without much difficulty he perſwaded the Princeſs <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the Widow of Marquis <hi>Conrade,</hi> to marry <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Champagne,</hi> to whom in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64918:117"/>regard of his Adherence to him,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1191</label> he was reſolved at his return to leave all that remained to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> the Promiſe which he made to the Princeſs to make her Queen of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Excluſion of <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> was the thing ſhe moſt paſſionately deſired, was the moſt powerful reaſon to induce her to this Marriage. Nor was it difficult for him to make good his Promiſe, in regard that on the one hand Count <hi>Henry</hi> was extremely beloved by the great men of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who had no manner of kindneſs for <hi>Luſignan;</hi> and on the other that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him in Exchange for a Kingdom, which was almoſt wholly loſt, to give him that of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> provided he payed to the Templers a certain Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for which he had engaged it to them. This deſpoiled Prince, whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune abſolutely depended upon his Protector, willingly received this Offer; ſo that ſhortly after, the Marriage was celebrated between the Count <hi>du Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who from that time took upon her the Title of the Queen of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> although <hi>Henry</hi> out of Modeſty would pretend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher than that of Prince. Thus all the Forces of the Realm being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Accomodation, <hi>Richard</hi> put himſelf at the Head of them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Champaign early in the Month of June, by the Siege of <hi>Darum</hi> which he took in four days, being one of the ſtrongeſt Fortreſſes which <hi>Saladin</hi> had; and after the taking of ſeveral other places of leſs Importance, which he put into the Hands of his Nephew, he returned to <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> joyned him with the <hi>French</hi> Troops under his Command. After which to ſave his Reputation, and that it might not appear to have been his Fault that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not taken, he ſeemed reſolved to beſiege and take it in good Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, which cauſed a mighty joy throughout the Army, which ſeemed to breath nothing but the conſummating of that glorious Enterpriſe. For this purpoſe he parted from <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> and advanced to <hi>Bethanopolis</hi> between <hi>Jaffa</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to the ſame place where he was poſted before, when he had a former Deſign of beſieging the City. When he arrived there he underſtood that a Part of the Army of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> was encamped behind the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, with a Deſign to fall upon him, when he ſhould be about making his Lodgements; whereupon he went and briskly fell upon them, and that with ſo much Fury and ſo little Expectation, that he cut the greateſt part of them in pieces, and put the reſt to Flight, taking all their Baggage, and ſo returned loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Booty to the Camp; whileſt this happened news was brought him, that the Caravan of <hi>Egypt</hi> guarded with above ten thouſand men with all ſorts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions for the Relief of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was advancing thither and at no great diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; whereupon taking five thouſand Horſe, he marched upon the Eve of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt to ſurprize them and charged them ſo Impetuouſly, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlain the greateſt part of the Convoy, with the loſs of not above ſeventeen or eighteen Horſemen, and diſſipated the reſt, he took betwixt four and five thouſand Camels, and an Infinite Number of other Beaſts of Burden, charged with Gold, Silver and precious Merchandiſes, not only for Neceſſity but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſuch as come from the Indies by the <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulph to <hi>Egypt.</hi> And this great Booty he deſtributed liberally among the Army without reſerving any thing for himſelf which was more then ever he had done in all the former Battles which he had gained.</p>
                  <p>And in Truth it ſeemed very reſonable that, after two ſuch great Victories, and the taking of ſuch a rich Convoy, the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not be a thing to be doubted; but the Joy which poſſeſſed the whole Army which with incredible Ardor undertook that Enterpriſe, was preſently after changed into an Exceſſive Grief, when the Reſolution of returning to <hi>Aſcalon</hi> was declared to them, as the Advice of twenty Captains whom <hi>Richard</hi> had choſen to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate concerning the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whileſt he marched to attack the Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van. For they all concluded, that the Siege was not by any means fit to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; alledging many weak and feeble reaſons, but concealing the true ones upon which it was grounded, which was that the King of <hi>England,</hi> had ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to return to his own Dominions; and that all which he had done was but to amuſe the World and to make a ſhew, as if he would beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> For he had received advice two ſeveral times, after Eaſter by two Expreſſes from <hi>England,</hi> that his Brother <hi>John,</hi> having by force diſplaced and driven
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64918:117"/>out of the Realm, the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> his Chancellor,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1192</label> and the Principal Officers of the Crown, manifeſtly intended to make himſelf King; he was alſo aſſured that he was powerfully protected by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was ready by force to take <hi>Vexin,</hi> becauſe it was refuſed to be ſurrendred to him, according to the Articles of <hi>Meſſina. Richard</hi> who was extreme haſty, would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately imbarked himſelf, leaving to the Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> with the Places in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> three hundred men at Arms, and two thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Forces of the Country for his Defence. But a certain <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick,</hi> a very able man, who was near his Perſon, and in whom he repoſed very much Confidence, perſwaded him to deferr his Departure for a little time, that ſo he might ſave his Honor, by making ſome Movement by which the World might be perſwaded that it was not his Fault that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not taken; and upon this Account it was, that he did all that is before mentioned, and that he would have thoſe twenty Captains of whom he was very well aſſured, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Affair concerning the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who by no means approved it; but urged, that it was much better to continue the Fortifications of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calon</hi> and <hi>Gaza,</hi> which were the two Keys of the Realm towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by that means to ſecure themſelves from the Attempts of <hi>Saladin,</hi> before they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Siege of the Capital City. So that <hi>Richard</hi> ſeemed only to deferr it upon the Opinion of ſo many knowing men who were choſen from among the Templers and Knights of the Hoſpital, the Lords of the Country, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe who come from <hi>Europe;</hi> after which he declared publickly, that ſince it was judged inconvenient at that time to attempt the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he would there leave thee Count <hi>de Champagne</hi> his Nephew to undertake it in due time; and that for himſelf he was obliged to return to defend his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt ſuch as laid hold of this Advantage of his Abſence to Enterprize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and to invade them.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Miſchief which this Imprudent Declaration oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, which he did before he had perfected his Treaty, with <hi>Saladin</hi> which was then a Foot; for <hi>Saladin</hi> ſeeing the Danger he was in to loſe all, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have ſome and to yield the reſt to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> upon moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Conditions: But ſo ſoon as he perceived that he had nothing to fear from that quarter, and that upon <hi>Richard</hi>'s reſolving to depart, the whole Army would Inſtantly disband; he held ſo firm and fierce, that a Truce in ſuch a manner as he pleaſed, was all that could be gained from him; a Truce unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Reputation and Courage of a King of <hi>England.</hi> the Army of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> being herewith moſt furiouſly inraged, and almoſt mad, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves robbed of the Glory of delivering the Holy Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, which they had with ſo much Danger, come ſo far to ſearch after, diſbanded of its one accord, the greateſt part of them thinking now of nothing but returning into their own Country, beſtowing a thouſand Curſes upon King <hi>Richard,</hi> whom they accuſed more than ever, to have aſſaſſinated the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> to have attempted againſt the Life of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and ſold the Holy Land to <hi>Saladin,</hi> with whom he held a Correſpondence. <hi>Richard</hi> by the Grandeur of his Soul and his Natural Courage, gave himſelf no manner of trouble, for what was the Effect of Rage and Anger, and the Malicious pleaſure, which men take to ſpeak Evil of thoſe whom Fortune or Merit have elevated above them or what they ſpoak ſo outragiouſly againſt his Conduct in this War; and, indeed in a ſhort time after he made it evident by a moſt glorious Action, that this laſt Accuſation was as great a Calumny as the two former.</p>
                  <p>For as he arrived at <hi>Acre,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> were alſo come to give order for their Return, he received advice that <hi>Saladin,</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was broken up, had laid Siege to <hi>Jaffa;</hi> Upon this news he rallied all the Troops he could, and dividing them into two Bodies, he gave one to the Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> with Orders to march by Land, and with the other he himſelf went by Sea, with the choice Lords of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> who would follow him upon this great occaſion. Thoſe who manifeſted the greateſt Ardour, and whom among others he choſe to be near his Perſon, were <hi>Gauchier de Chaſtillon,</hi> who had loſt his Brother in the Siege of <hi>Acre.</hi> the Counts of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and <hi>Limbourg,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Stanford, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leran
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64918:118"/>de Luxenburg, Guy de Montfort, Bartholomew de Mortemar, Raoul de Maule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, William de L' Eſtang, Andrew de Savigni, Henry de Nevile, Dreux de Mello,</hi> and <hi>William de Barres.</hi> He was for ſome time ſtayed by contrary Winds, and did not arrive, till preciſely the Evening of that day, wherein thoſe who had retired into the Caſtle, after the taking of the City, had promiſed to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they were not before that time relieved. The <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſeeing him coming, had put themſelves in <hi>Battalia,</hi> upon the Bank to hinder his Deſcent; and the greateſt part looking upon ſuch an Attempt as impoſſible, adviſed the King to return: But this undaunted Prince, perceiving that the Caſtle yet held out, cauſing his Shallop to row cloſe to the Shoar, was the firſt that leapt into the Sea, and drew the reſt after him, rather by the extreme Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which they ſaw him expoſe himſelf, than by the Force of ſuch a brave Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and after he had routed the <hi>Saraſins</hi> who fled inſtantly amazed at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Boldneſs, he ſtormed the Town by the ſame Breaches which they had made, and cutting in pieces thoſe who beſieged the Caſtle; he conſtrained <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> with the remainder of his Troops, to retire in great diſorder to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</p>
                  <p>But this was not all; for three days after, ſeven thouſand choſen men of the moſt brave of all <hi>Saladin</hi>'s Army, thinking to ſurprize him early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Quarters while he was aſleep, taking the Alarm he ſo quickly ralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Troops of Infantry could be gotten together on the ſudden, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them ſo well into a ſquare Battalion, that they durſt never ſo much as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him; for he had ſo ranged his men, that between every Pike, who kneeled with one knee upon the Ground, two Croſs-Bows were placed, one of which charged the Croſs-Bows, whileſt the other let fly the Mortal Arrows among them without ceaſing; and at laſt ſeeing the Enemies diſordered by the great Showers of thoſe dreadful forked Arrows, and that they did nothing but wheel about his Battalion which had a Front every way, he by an exceſs of Courage, or rather Temerity threw himſelf on Horſe-Back into the midſt of his Enemies, although he had not with him above ten Lords, who were mounted as he was, the Cheif of which were the Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Mortemar, Raoul de Mauleon, Andrew de Savigni, William de L' Estang,</hi> and <hi>Henry de Nevile.</hi> There he did ſhew the Prodigies of Valour with thoſe Generous Lords, who by his Example combated like ſo many inraged Lyons. He relieved <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who happened to be diſmounted; he cut off the Arms of thoſe who had ſeized upon the Lord <hi>Mauleon</hi> to make him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; his Sword like Lightning flew every way, carrying Death and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror along with it among his Enimies, and at laſt ſeeing the General who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who was animating his men to the Combat, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of Cowardice to ſuffer ſuch a handful to triumph over them, he ran up to him and with a mighty Blow of his Falchion cut off his Head and right Arm cloſe by the Shoulder, ſo that he fell dead among the Horſes Feet. This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Blow ſo terrified the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> that they durſt not come near him, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked him at a diſtance with their Arrows; ſo that at laſt weary of their Slaughter he returned to his Camp, the Capariſon of his Horſe being briſtled with the Enemies Arrows of whom he left ſeven hundred Extended upon the Earth without having loſt any more then two of his Men.</p>
                  <p>In truth ſuch a Noble and Heroick Action, made it moſt apparent that there was no manner of Underſtanding between him and <hi>Saladin,</hi> againſt whom, if there had, certainly he would never have fought with ſuch apparent Hazard of his Perſon to drive him out of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> after he had taken it. But all this did not hinder, but that <hi>Saladin,</hi> who ſaw very well that <hi>Richard,</hi> who was fallen ſick after this Combat, was not only reſolved but neceſſitated to return into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> obliged him in Concluſion to accept of a Truce with ſuch Conditions as he was pleaſed to give, as if he had been the Conqueror. They were theſe. <hi>That the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould demoliſh all the places which they had ſiezed upon, ſince the taking of</hi> Acre, <hi>and above all</hi> Aſcalon. <hi>That all the Coaſt from</hi> Tyre <hi>to</hi> Jaffa, <hi>ſhould be in the Power of the</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>that the rest ſhould remain in the Poſſeſſion of</hi> Saladin, <hi>except</hi> Aſcalon, <hi>which upon the Expiration of the Truce, ſhould fall to his

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1192</label> and that</hi> Richard <hi>ſhould be ſatisfied from him for the Expences which he had been at in the Fortifications of that Place. That during the Truce, which was to begin at</hi> Eaſter, <hi>in the following Year, and to continue for three Years, three Months, three Weeks, and three Days, the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould have liberty, in ſmall numbers, freely to enter into</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to make there their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the Holy Sepulchre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus this great <hi>Cruſade,</hi> wherein all the Forces of <hi>Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were employed under three of the greateſt Princes of the Univerſe, againſt one ſingle Conqueror, ended, at laſt, in nothing more than the Taking of one poor Town, which coſt the Lives of an infinite number of brave Men; the leaſt part of which, if they had been under the Command of one ſingle Captain, might with eaſe have conquered the whole Eaſtern Empire. But it is never to be expected, or hoped, but that Hatred, Envy, Ambition, Jealouſie of State, and Diverſity of Intereſts, which never fail to happen among plurality of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, ſhould ever ſuffer theſe kind of Unions to continue firm or long: And it would be a kind of Prodigy, if they ſhould not, according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, produce thoſe Diviſions and Animoſities, which alone, without the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of other Miſchiefs, are capable of ruining the greateſt Enterpriſes, and the braveſt Armies: Whereas one ſingle Chief, with far leſs number, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly triumph over the greateſt Multitude, leagued againſt him, provided he hath but Patience to permit Diſcords to enter into the Camp of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and will but give them leave to overthrow themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Truce being ſigned, <hi>Richard,</hi> who found himſelf ſtill worſe in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom Air of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> cauſed himſelf to be removed to <hi>Caiphas;</hi> where <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had naturally a generous Soul, ſent to viſit him, with great Marks of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Eſteem and Reſpect: He alſo very obligingly received the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who, with the reſt of the Pilgrims, went thither, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Vows of the King, who ſtill continued much indiſpoſed in his Health. And after he had moſt courteouſly entertained that Prelate, he obliged him to demand what Favour lay in his Power; and promiſed, he would grant it. Whereupon the Biſhop requeſted, that, not only in the Church of the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, but thoſe of <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> there might be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main two <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts, and two Deacons, with freedom publickly to celebrate Divine Service in thoſe places: to which <hi>Saladin</hi> without any difficulty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Word, accorded. After this, the King, finding his Health in ſome meaſure re-eſtabliſhed, repaired to <hi>Acre,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was dead of the Diſtemper, ſome eight Days before his Arrival: There he cauſed his Fleet to be rigged, upon which he embarked the two Queens, with the greateſt part of his Forces; who, not long after, happily arrived in <hi>England:</hi> And about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> he alſo departed, with the Diſpleaſure of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on one ſide concluded a Truce, moſt inglorious and diſadvantageous to the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and on the other, with the Honour and Pleaſure, at his parting, to have beſtowed two Kingdoms, that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was a very piteous one, but yet a Kingdom, upon the Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> his Nephew; and that of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he had conquered, upon <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> in which Houſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two hundred and eighty Years. Thus it was that King <hi>Richard</hi> left the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> with a Promiſe to theſe two Princes, that, upon the Expiration of the Truce, he would return with more powerful Forces; and to perſuade the World that this Reſolution of his was in ſerious Earneſt, he continued ſtill to wear the Pilgrim's Croſs upon his Habit.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, his natural Impatience and Temerity made him commit two mighty Faults, which rendred his Return very unfortunate. For firſt, Whereas he ought to have embarked himſelf like a great King, upon a gallant Fleet, that ſo he might return with Security, and the ſame Magnificence with which he came, he ſatisfied himſelf with one great Ship, in which he might eaſily, by Sea, have fallen either into the hands of Enemies or Pyrates; and after that, when he was at <hi>Corſu,</hi> perceiving that his Veſſel was a Slug, and made no Way, he threw himſelf, for the more Expedition, into a Galliot, and was, by Tempeſt, driven into the Gulph of <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was ſhipwrack'd between that place and the City <hi>Aquilea;</hi> and having run a thouſand Dangers in croſſing through

This Prince, to cover his abominable Avarice, which made him ſo unjuſtly detain this King, only to draw a great Ranſom from him, made his publick Pretence, that all this was to do Reaſon for what <hi>Richard</hi> had done to his Prejudice in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and for the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and thoſe other Crimes of which he had been accuſed in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But <hi>Richard,</hi> who was naturally cloquent, in a full Diet before the Princes of the Empire at <hi>Spire,</hi> made his Innocence ſo evidently appear, that the whole Aſſembly was moved for him, even to Tears, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Emperor that, for the future, he might be treated like a King; which the Emperor, more out of Shame than Honour, conſented to.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> alſo ſollicited by the Letters of Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> which were all in the Style of <hi>Peter de Blois,</hi> who writ them; and by the Prayers and Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Gautier</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Normandy;</hi> who, upon this occaſion, manifeſted great Ardor and Affection for the Service of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> did all that he poſſibly could, to obtain his Liberty. He proceeded ſo far as to denounce the <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> for daring to make a Priſoner of a Pilgrim, expreſly contrary to an Article of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which denounces Excommunication againſt ſuch as ſhould attempt any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Perſons or Eſtates of ſuch as had taken upon them the Croſs.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1194</label> poor <hi>Richard</hi> could not be ſet at Liberty, till, after above a Years Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he payed a hundred thouſand Marks in Silver before his Releaſment, and left fifty Hoſtages, among which was the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fifty thouſand Marks more; of which, the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was to have twenty thouſand, and the third part of the hundred thouſand already received by the Emperor. So that, to raiſe this Sum, all <hi>England</hi> was taxed; and even the Chalices and conſecrated Veſſels were forced to be melted down and coyned. So far was this Prince, who was falſly accuſed to have ſold <hi>Paleſtine</hi> to <hi>Saladin,</hi> from making any Advantage of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that it is moſt certain, that, in this Expedition he ſpent an immenſe Treaſure, to the great Impoveriſhment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his whole Realm.</p>
                  <p>But as he had not made this Treaty, but whilſt he was under a Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, therefore, ſo ſoon as he was returned into <hi>England,</hi> he ſent his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the Pope, to demand Juſtice from him. He deſired of him, that ſince, by virtue of the Protection of the Holy See, it was promiſed to all the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that their Perſons and Eſtates ſhould be free from Injuries, during the whole time of their Pilgrimage, that he would, by all ſorts of Canonical Ways, compel the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to ſet at liberty his Hoſtages, to reſtore the Money which they had ſo unjuſtly exacted from him, and to make him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the cruel Injury which they had done him, contrary to all the Laws, both Humane and Divine. <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> who ſaw that the Treaty of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which was univerſally received and confirmed, without Contradiction, was manifeſtly infringed in this great Article, could not refuſe to do him Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. He therefore, according to the Canons, cauſed theſe two Princes to be three ſeveral times admoniſhed to make Satisfaction in theſe Particulars; and ſeeing that they perſiſted obſtinately to deride his Threatnings, he did anew denounce the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Church, firſt againſt <hi>Leopold,</hi> and then againſt the Emperor, with all the uſual Solemnities. The Duke hereupon became more obſtinate, and was ſo far tranſported, as to threaten the Hoſtages which he had with Death. But it was not long before all the World believed, that thoſe terrible Scourges with which the Duke was chaſtiſed, and that deplorable Accident

                  <p>And, in truth, beſides that many of his Cities were deſtroyed, either by Fire from Heaven, or by the Waters of the <hi>Danubius,</hi> which drowned the greateſt part of his Country, in which Plague and Famine made a horrible Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, one Day, when he had made a magnificent Entertainment at <hi>Gretz,</hi> to celebrate his Birth-day, his Horſe falling upon him, broke his Leg; after which, a Fire in ſuch furious manner ſeized upon the Part, that, unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the violence of the pain of that terrible Inflammation, he cauſed it to be cut off; but the Inflammation, of whoſe Nature the Phyſicians were wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, mounted from his Leg, to his Thigh; and from his Thigh, expanding its Flame through his whole Body, he then acknowledged that it was the Hand of God which was upon him, confeſſed his Fault, delivered the Hoſtages of King <hi>Richard,</hi> became a Penitent, received Abſolution from the Biſhops, and died in the Peace of the Church, after he had, by his laſt Will and Teſtament, ordered Reſtitution to be made to <hi>Richard,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> of all the Money which he had received from him. But it is commonly to be obſerved, that theſe kind of Reſtitutions, with which dying Perſons charge their Executors, are rarely diſcharged by the Living: And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. who ſucceeded <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin,</hi> had not a little trouble with the Succeſſors of <hi>Leopold,</hi> when he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to oblige them to the Performance of that part of his Will, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reſtitution perſuading them againſt the Juſtice of it. But as to any thing further, it is to be obſerved, that neither this <hi>Leopold,</hi> nor his Succeſſors, of whom I diſcourſe, were at all related to thoſe Princes who, at preſent, poſſeſs the Title of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> that Family, which, about a hundred Years after, entred into the Houſe of <hi>Hapsbourg,</hi> being deſcended from the Houſe of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> from which, that Auguſt Family, which now bears the name of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> derives its Original.</p>
                  <p>In this time the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Eaſt remained in great Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in reference to the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who willingly maintained a Truce which was ſo extreamly advantageous to them, and which gave them reaſon to hope, that in a ſmall time they ſhould become Maſters of all the Remainder of <hi>Syria:</hi> But they happened to be ſomething embroiled, by a kind of Civil War, which was like to break out by the Treachery of <hi>Bohemond,</hi> the third of that Name, Prince of <hi>Antioch.</hi> For, being a Man of great Ambition, little Prudence, and leſs Power to ſupport it, he had recourſe to unworthy Artifices and Cheats, which he made uſe of to oppreſs the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princes, his Neighbours, whoſe Power and Greatneſs, which increaſed every day, gave him a troubleſom Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. He had, by theſe Cowardly ways, made <hi>Rupin</hi> of the Mountain his Priſoner, upon pretext of a Conference, and thought to have done the ſame to <hi>Livon,</hi> who did not only ſucceed in the Power of his Brother <hi>Rupin,</hi> but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more ſucceſsful, and augmented that Power, by the taking of divers places from <hi>Bohemond.</hi> This Prince, after he had made an Accommodation with him, thought to have ſurprized him alſo in the ſame manner; and having ſent to him, to deſire an Interview in a certain place, he reſolved there to ſeize upon him, and make him his Priſoner. But <hi>Livon,</hi> who followed the Maxim of thoſe who hold, <hi>That one ought never to truſt a Man who hath once violated his Faith,</hi> came to the place appointed ſtrongly guarded, with a great number of brave Men, whom he placed in Ambuſcade, in a place at a convenient diſtance from the place of Meeting; and then advancing, only accompanied with two Perſons, according as it was concluded between them, perceiving by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which <hi>Bohemond</hi> had with him, the Treachery which was intended, he gave the Signal to his People, who immediately came pouring in upon <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and ſurprized him, putting him into the hands of Prince <hi>Livon,</hi> who carried him Priſoner into his Dominions. Count <hi>Henry,</hi> who ſaw well that this Quarrel muſt neceſſarily divide all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Eaſt, went himſelf into <hi>Armenia;</hi> where he was, by <hi>Livon,</hi> received with all the Reſpect imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but with a ſtrong Reſolution, nevertheleſs, to draw all the Advantage he could poſſibly from his good Fortune, as indeed he did: For the Count ſo
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64918:120"/>well managed the Spirit of <hi>Bohemond,</hi>

                  <p>It is moſt certain that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> might have drawn extraordinary Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from theſe Diviſions which began to ariſe among the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but the Divine Providence averted that Misfortune, by the Revolution which happened in the Empire of the Infidels, by the Deceaſe of <hi>Saladin,</hi> who, amidſt theſe Actions, died at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> after he had tamed all the Rebels on this ſide <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi> He was certainly a Prince, notwithſtanding all the <hi>Saraſin</hi> he had about him, who was poſſeſſed of Vertues and Qualities, which might well be compared with thoſe of the moſt famous Conquerors of Antiquity; and who, after having performed a thouſand noble Actions in his Life, did one at his Death which ought to be received by Poſterity, as a moſt admirable Lecture of the Vanity of all Earthly Pomp and Glory: For, ſome Moments before his Death, calling for him who uſed to carry his Banner before him in all his Battles, he commanded him to tie to the Top of a Lance a Linen Shrowd, in which he was to be wrap'd at his Interment; and diſplaying it, as being the Standard of Death, which triumphed over ſo great a Prince, to make this Proclamation; <hi>This is all which the great</hi> Saladin, <hi>Vanquiſher and Maſter of the Empire of the Eaſt, muſt carry with him, out of the World, of all the Treaſures and the Glory which he hath acquired by ſo many mighty Conqueſts.</hi> A rare Spectacle, and moſt worthy to be eternally regarded by the greateſt Kings, who, from hence, may ſee and know, that, though their Birth and Fortune have elevated them above the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of Mankind; yet Death, which will one day equal them with the meaneſt of their Subjects, will ſtrip them of all the Pomp and Grandure of this World; and that nothing but the Riches of the Soul, and the Glories of their Vertue, will diſtinguiſh them from others in the Life to come.</p>
                  <p>As to the reſt; This great Prince, who, by the Obligations of his Birth, and the Policy of State, upon which his Intereſt and his Fortune depended, had, during his Life, made publick Profeſſion of <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> at his Death ſeemed not ſo very well ſatisfied of the Truth of that Sect; for, after he had diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his Dominions in favour of his Children, he divided all his Perſonal Eſtate into three Parts, which he ordered to be equally diſtributed among the poor <hi>Saraſins, Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which ſhould be found in all his Dominions. And this he did with an Imagination, that, at his Death, he having theſe three Strings to his Bow, though two ſhould fail, he ſhould be ſure of the third; and that, though he loſt two Thirds of his Alms upon two falſe Religions, yet the other falling upon the true, he ſhould undoubtedly find Advantage by it, for the good of his Soul. Poor, well meaning Prince! He did not know that there is a vaſt difference between Temporal and Eternal Goods: And that though thoſe are ſubmitted to the Empire of Fortune, which gives or takes them, according as ſhe pleaſes to turn her ſporting Wheel; yet in theſe it is far otherwiſe, and that Eternal Goods are never expoſed to Hazard and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture but they are certainly loſt.</p>
                  <p>The Death of <hi>Saladin</hi> preſently made a Change in the Face of Affairs throughout all <hi>Aſia:</hi> For, having divided his Dominions among his twelve Sons, without leaving any thing to his Brother <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who had moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved him in all his Wars. This Prince, valiant and ambitious, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to revenge himſelf upon the firſt Opportunity; nor was it long before it was offered, and by him laid hold of: For his Nephew, to whoſe Share, in the Diſtribution, <hi>Egypt</hi> fell, being ſlain by a Fall from his Horſe, as he was hunting, <hi>Saphadin,</hi> with Eaſe, made himſelf Maſter of that fair Dominion; and preſently raiſing a powerful Army, all the Soldiers of <hi>Saladin,</hi> who had ſerved under him, and eſteemed him, infinitely running in to him, he attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the Ruin of his other Nephews; and in a ſhort time, either by Force of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64918:120"/>Arms, or by Treachery of their Subjects, he overthrew them all,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1195</label> in ſuch a glorious Deſign, they were engaged in a moſt cruel War, which was only diſcontinued for ſome time, by little Truces, which ſerved to no other purpoſe, but to give them leiſure to take Breath a little, and thereby to put themſelves into a Condition to attack each other with greater Fury than before. The Emperor was wholly taken up with putting himſelf into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> in Right of his Wife <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> the Empreſs: In purſuit of which, after the death of <hi>Tancred,</hi> he extinguiſhed the whole Race of thoſe brave <hi>Normans,</hi> who had ſo generouſly conquered, and ſo gloriouſly poſſeſſed thoſe Realms for above one Age. Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> III. wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Age and Fatigues, being now advanced to ninety Years, was in no Condition to undertake ſo difficult a Task as the Forming of a new <hi>Cruſade:</hi> And beſides, he was extreamly embroiled with the Emperor, whom he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for the Violence which he had uſed to the King of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that he had little hope to engage him in the Enterpriſe. Nevertheleſs, after he was aſſured of the death of <hi>Saladin,</hi> and the great Revolutions which that had made in his Empire; which he underſtood by Letters from <hi>Henry Dandolo,</hi> Doge of <hi>Venice;</hi> he applied himſelf, with the ſame Zeal which his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had done, to form a Holy League among the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this fair Opportunity for the re-gaining of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe he ſent his Legates throughout all <hi>Europe:</hi> He did all that lay in his power to procure Peace between the two Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and conjured them, at leaſt, to ſend ſome Aſſiſtance to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> if the poſture of their Affairs was ſuch, as would not permit them to go thither in Perſon, to deliver the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1195</label> and Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> and to his Suffragan Biſhops, to oblige them to preach the <hi>Cruſade</hi> throughout <hi>England.</hi> And he was determined alſo to conſtrain, by the Cenſures of the Church, all ſuch, as, having not accompliſhed their Vow, had quitted the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> to take it upon them again; and, with all convenient Expedition, to put themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Condition to undertake the Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> Or however, if their imperfect Health would not allow of their undertaking it in Perſon, to ſend a Man in their place, who might be able to ſerve in that War. But, after all the Care and Pains of this devout Pope, he found very ſlender Effects of them in the two Realms: For <hi>Philip,</hi> who, after having diſcharged his Vow, no longer carried the Croſs, was not at all inclined to re-aſſume it, nor to joyn himſelf again with a Prince, of whom he had ſo many and great Subjects to complain; and with whom it was almoſt impoſſible that he ſhould have any firm or durable Peace; ſo much did their Intereſts, as well as their Humours, contradict each other. However, he permitted the two Cardinal Legates, whom the Pope had ſent to him, to cauſe the <hi>Cruſade</hi> to be preached in <hi>France;</hi> where many took it upon themſelves, fully reſolved to undertake that Voyage with the firſt Opportunity that ſhould fairly offer it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> ſtill carried the Croſs upon his Habits, as a Token that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, upon the Expiration of the Truce, to return to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But the Troubles which he daily created to himſelf, as by degrees they leſſened his Inclinations, ſo alſo, at length, they took from him the power of putting that Deſign in Execution: So that he was forced to make the beſt of it, by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Great Men of his Realm to undertake the Expedition, for the Health of their Souls, and his; and ſince, he ſaid, he was not in a Condition to ſatisfie the Deſire and Intention which he had, once more to combat againſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> in Perſon, he hoped he ſhould, in ſome ſort, accompliſh thoſe Intentions, by the brave Actions which thoſe, who ſhould ſupply his place, would perform in that War. But for all that, this turned to no great Account; whether it were that the Lords were a little ſhock'd with the thoughts of a Voyage ſo long, dangerous and toilſom, or that they eaſily diſcovered the little Sincerity in theſe Diſcourſes of the King, who, they knew, had much rather that they ſhould ſtay at home, than abandon him in the Wars which he then had with <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope therefore, perceiving that he was to expect little Aid, either from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch an unlucky Conjuncture, turned all his Thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Emperor, in hopes that that Prince would not be diſpleaſed with ſo fair an Occaſion of putting himſelf into good Terms with the Holy See. And in truth, this way, which ſeemed next to impoſſible, after ſuch a notorious Breach as had been betwixt the Pope and the Emperor, had an unexpected and undifficult Succeſs. For <hi>Henry</hi> reſolved abſolutely, upon this Occaſion, to give the Pope all manner of Satisfaction; whether it were that he was really touched with a true Remorſe for his paſt Faults, and that hereby he thought to oblige <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> to reſtore him to the Peace of the Church; or that he was glad to have ſo fair an Opportunity to return into <hi>Italy</hi> with a powerful Army, where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her ſelf, highly diſſatisfied with his Conduct towards the <hi>Norman</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had raiſed a potent Intereſt againſt him: It is certain that he received the Cardinal <hi>Gregory</hi> in an extraordinary manner at <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> where, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Italy,</hi> he had cauſed an Aſſembly of the States and Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He moſt favourably heard the Speech which the Legate made to him at the Diet, when he preſented to him the Letters of <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> in which the Pope, without taking the leaſt notice of their former Differences, or the <hi>Anathema</hi> which he had denounced againſt him, exhorted him, as if there had never been any Unkindneſs, or Breach between them, to take upon him the Croſs, and to unite all the Forces of the Empire, to gain the Glory of eſtabliſhing that of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> The Emperor hereupon, at leaſt in outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, embraced that glorious Deſign with all his Heart, and proteſted publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was ready to do whatſoever the Pope ſhould deſire, in reference to this holy Enterpriſe; and that he was reſolved to employ his Eſtate, his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his Life, to put it in Execution; and, following the Example of his

                  </p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe he called a general Diet at <hi>Wormes,</hi> where almoſt all the Princes, Eccleſiaſtick and Secular, were aſſembled, about the latter end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi> There he ſolemnly declared, in the Cathedral Church, his Reſolution to undertake the Holy War, in a Diſcourſe which moved the whole Aſſembly. After which, eight of the moſt famous and eloquent Biſhops, every one in his Turn, did, for eight days, make elaborate Speeches upon this Subject; and diſcourſed it with ſo much Force and Zeal, that the whole Aſſembly took upon them the Croſs; ſome out of a true Sentiment of Piety, and a ſuddain Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Devotion; others by the Obligation of Shame, not to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſo many Great Men, after the Throng of whom, they were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for their Honour, to permit themſelves to ſwim along that generous Stream. Thus it ſometimes happens, that Men do well, even contrary to their own Inclinations, when, by a kind of Neceſſity, they find themſelves forced by the Company and Example of ſuch as out of good Inclinations, and Greatneſs of Soul, follow the Paths of Piety and Vertue. The moſt remarkable of thoſe, who, in this Aſſembly, took upon them the Croſs, were <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Otho</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg, Henry</hi> Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhine, Harman</hi> Lantgrave of <hi>Thuringia, Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant, Albert</hi> Count of <hi>Hapsbourg, Adolphus</hi> Count of <hi>Scawenbourg, Henry</hi> Count <hi>de Pappenheim,</hi> Mareſhal of the Empire; the Duke of <hi>Bavaria, Frederick,</hi> the Son of <hi>Leopold,</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria; Conrade</hi> Marquis of <hi>Moravia, Valeran,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Limbourg;</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Wirtzbourg, Breme, Verden, Halberſtad, Paſſau</hi> and <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which was the moſt extraordinary, and which deſerves the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Ages, was, that <hi>Bela</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> being dead not long before this Diet, Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> his Widow, the Siſter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and who had ſome time worn the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as Wife to the young <hi>Henry,</hi> finding her ſelf a ſecond time in a State of Freedom, was reſolved to employ that Liberty, together with her Life and Fortunes, in the Service of Jeſus Chriſt, in this fourth <hi>Cruſade.</hi> For this purpoſe ſhe took upon her the Croſs, and ſolemnly engaged her ſelf in this Holy War, with the Reſolution of a true Heroine; and having joyned her Troops with the Army of the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> ſhe under went the Voyage with them, with as great Zeal and Ardour as any of them, and with far more Conſtancy, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſolution. For, being aſhamed of the precipitate Return of the others, who unworthily abandoned the Intereſts of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eaſt, in the very Heat of the War, ſhe only remained unmoveable in her firſt Reſolution, and paſſed all the Remainder of her Days at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> that ſo ſhe might be always ready, upon all Occaſions which offered, either to attack the <hi>Infidels,</hi> or defend the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> An Example which confirms what hath been frequently ſeen in other Princeſſes, that Heroick Vertue does not at all depend upon the Quality of the Sex; but that the weakneſs of Temper and Body may be ſupplied by the greatneſs of the Soul, and the Vigour of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>During this time, the Letters of the Pope, with thoſe of the Emperor, which were ſent all over <hi>Germany,</hi> produced ſuch Effects upon the Minds of Men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready filled and prepoſſeſſed with the haughty Idea's which they had conceived of a <hi>Cruſade,</hi> wherein the Empire only ſhould be concerned; ſo that every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, willing to ſignalize themſelves upon this Occaſion, furniſhed out a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of <hi>Cruſades.</hi> Inſomuch that the Emperor found wherewithal, abundantly to ſatisfie, not only the great Deſire which he ſeemed to have to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Holy War, but alſo that which in reallity he had, which was, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretext, to lead a potent Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> to exterminate the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Normans,</hi> who had cauſed a Revolt in the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> And that he might play his Game with greater Succeſs, by covering his principal Intendment under this ſpecious Appearance of a mighty Zeal, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to take the Croſs from the hand of the Legate; proteſting that for the Accompliſhment of his Promiſe, and to animate others by his Example, he was reſolved to march at the Head of his Army, and, in Perſon, to combat againſt the Infidels. But whether it were that they diſcovered his Artifice, and

So that, after ſome ſmall Struggling, and faint Oppoſitions, he ſubmitted to the Requeſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and, in concluſion, reſolved to ſet on foot three great Armies, that ſo he might make profitable uſe of that infinite multitude of Soldiers who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them the Croſs, throughout all the Provinces of <hi>Germany.</hi>

And as it uſually happens, that one Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune follows another, the Garriſon of the beſieged City making an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sally, <hi>Saphadin</hi> counterfeiting a Flight, drew them ſo far, that with his Horſe he cut off their Retreat, and then turning head upon them, he attacked them ſo furiouſly on all ſides, that they were all cut in Pieces. After which, forcing the City without much Reſiſtance, he put all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in it to the Sword, and to deliver himſelf at once from the Fears of this dangerous Poſt, which might ſo much incommode <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he cauſed the City to be intirely ruined from the very Foundations.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt theſe Matters were tranſacting, the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> with the other Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> a Councel of War was held, where it was determined to march immediately againſt <hi>Saphadin,</hi> in regard that his Army being at preſent Maſter of the Field after his Victory, and that he had equipped a powerful Navy in <hi>Egypt,</hi> conſequently if they did not indeavour preſently to remove him by giving him Battle, he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity hinder all manner of Paſſage of Proviſions both by Sea and Land, whereby they ſhould be reduced to great Extremities at <hi>Acre.</hi> They were not long ſearching for an Opportunity, for <hi>Saphadin,</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to draw to him to a Combat, advanced towards the City of <hi>Baruth,</hi> which he was obliged to relieve, being extreme brave, and his Army ſince the taking of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> very much augmented, he took the ſame Reſolution of fighting them, and to meet them half way, he deſcended from the Mountains of <hi>Antilchanon</hi> to the Plain by the Sea, there to oppoſe them in their Paſſage. So that the two Armies happening to Rencounter between <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> the Battle was fought in the plain Field, with an incredible Courage on the one ſide and the other, and with far more Obſtinacy on the part of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> than had ever been known in any of the preceding Wars.</p>
                  <p>For as they were grown very Martial, having for ſo long time been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Wars without any Interruption, either againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or againſt thoſe of their own Nation ſince the Death of <hi>Saladin,</hi> and their civil Broils; ſo they were mightily animated by the happy Succeſs which they had met with in the Siege of <hi>Jaffa;</hi> and <hi>Saphadin</hi> who commanded them, forgot nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, that could be expected from a compleat General, and one of the gallanteſt Men in the World: So that their Efforts were wholly extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; whileſt they indeavoured to follow the Example of ſo great a Captain, and to preſerve the Glory and Advantage which they had already gained. On the other ſide, the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were no leſs Brave, and much better armed than theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and who had at the Head of them ſo many great Princes, who animated them not only with their Voice and Geſture, but by the gallant Actions which they ſaw them perform, combated ſo generouſly, and ſo briskly purſued their Point, continually preſſing upon the Enemy, without ſo much as recoiling a ſingle Step, or making the leaſt Halt, as determining either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or periſh, that in Concluſion the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were never before known for ſo long time to maintain a ſtanding Fight againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> were put into Diſorder, and in a few Moments after, to an intire Rout and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Flight, leaving all the Field covered with the Bodies of the Slain, among

                  <p>This glorious Victory was followed by the Reduction of the greateſt part of the Cities which the <hi>Saraſins</hi> had ſeized; <hi>Sidon, Laodicea</hi> in <hi>Syria, Giblet,</hi> and ſeveral other Places of leſſer Importance, either ſurrendred themſelves or were taken without much Difficulty.

Upon the ſight of theſe two mighty Armies, which at the ſame time appeared before the City, the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> altho they had there a very ſtrong Garriſon, were ſo diſmaid, that they ſuffered the Caſtle to be taken by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captives, who in that Conſternation found means to knock off their Irons; and in Concluſion, the <hi>Infidels</hi> diſpairing to be able to Defend the Place, made haſt to ſave themſelves by abandoning the Town to the Conquerors, who there found an ineſtimable Booty. There the Princes, to give a Chieftain to the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a Succeſſor to Count <hi>Henry,</hi> without much Trouble perſuaded Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> to Marry <hi>Emri de Luſignan,</hi> who was her fourth Husband, and who joyned the Crown of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to that of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto all things ſucceeded moſt admirably to the Army of the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade;</hi> and if after this happy beginning they had marched ſtraight to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is almoſt certain, that in the Condition wherein the City then was, without all manner of Hopes of being relieved, and under a Prince who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeemed to Capitulate, it muſt either have been ſurrendred upon Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or carried by Force. But there is no time wherein it is not eaſy to obſerve, that thoſe who have known very well how to Vanquiſh their Enemies, have not yet been ſo Fortunate as to know how to make the beſt Uſe of their Victories; and that they have loſt all the Fruit of their gallant Actions, for want of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Time and their Enemies by the Head, after ſuch conſiderable Defeats: For the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> whereas they ought immediately to have lead the conquering Army to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to take all the Advantage they could of the Diſorder of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> before they could be able to recover the Conſternation of the Blow, and to re-ſettle their Affairs; they very unadviſedly undertook the Siege of <hi>Thoron,</hi> which was the moſt impregnable of all the Places which the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> yet held in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and the moſt able to ſtop the Courſe of a Victorious Army to no purpoſe. This place was rather a great Caſtle than a Town, which <hi>Hugh de</hi> St. <hi>Omer,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> had beforetime cauſed to be built in the Reign of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the I. about ſeven or eight Leagues from <hi>Tyre</hi> towards the Eaſt, to oppoſe the Excurſions of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who at that time were Maſters of that great City. It was ſituate upon the top of a high Mountain, which was invironed round with broaken Rocks, which rendred it wholly inacceſſible to an Army; for there was no coming to it, but by one way, which was very Narrow, and on each hand whereof lay moſt dreadful Precipices, ſo that a few Defendants might eaſily maintain it againſt all the Forces of the Earth, only by rolling down great Stones in this narrow Way, where not above two Men
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64918:125"/>could march abreaſt: The Lords of <hi>Thoron</hi> had alſo taken great Care;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1197</label> to add all that Art could do, towards the Fortification of it, as far as the Invention of thoſe Times would admit, to render the Place impregnable.</p>
                  <p>The Army coming to incamp before it in the beginning of the Winter, it was quickly perceivable that the way of Force would be to no purpoſe againſt a place of that Nature; for there were no kind of Engines which could be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proportionably to the height of the Walls and Towers, to batter them; the Darts, Arrows, and Stones which were thrown from below upwards, loſt all their Force of doing any Execution, before they could come at the Beſieged, who laughed at the vain Efforts which were uſed againſt them; whereas at the ſame time their Engines diſcharging from above, ſhowred down a furious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of Darts, Stones, and Arrows, upon the Camp, which had much to do to cover it ſelf from the dreadful Storm. They indeavoured however, by mining, to find a Way under the Earth, after the Example of the Dictator <hi>Camillus,</hi> who by that means entred the City of <hi>Veiae,</hi> ſcituate like <hi>Thoron</hi> upon the top of a Mountain. But the <hi>German</hi> Engineers who began the Work, found the Rock ſo very hard, that they diſpaired of Succeſs,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1198</label> and were at laſt obliged to give it over; ſo that after three Months ſpent unprofitably in the Siege, they found themſelves no nearer taking the Place, than when they firſt ſate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. In the mean time <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who was cured of his Wound, had time to levy Men, and raiſe an Army more numerous than before, with which he intended to beſiege the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their Camp. Nevertheleſs <hi>Thoron,</hi> which began to be in great want of Proviſions, and which had already deſired to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate, had undoubtedly fallen into the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if the Avarice and infamous Treaſon of thoſe, whoſe principal Intereſt it was to have it taken, had not ſaved it. For the Templers, who ſerved in the Army, and whoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were already abominably degenerated, ſuffered themſelves to be corrupted by the Gold of <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who promiſed them vaſt Summs if they would find out ſome way to cauſe the Siege to be raiſed; they therefore gained by the ſame way <hi>Conrade</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wirtzbourg,</hi> the Emperor's Chancellor, who either out of Jealouſie and Envy of the Glory of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> who commanded the whole Army; or blinded with the Luſtre of the prodigious quantity of Gold which was offered him, no longer regarded either his Conſcience, his Honour, his Truth, or Fidelity, Vertues which in all Ages have been the Glory of the <hi>German</hi> Nation; but that he joyned with the wicked Templers to betray the Intereſts of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For having perſuaded the greateſt part of the <hi>Italian</hi> Captains, who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to enter into the ſame Sentiments with himſelf; theſe joyned with the Templers made the major part of the Councel: And firſt therefore he oppoſed the receiving the Beſieged to Conditions, alledging that it was impoſſible but they muſt preſently come and ſubmit themſelves with Halters about their Necks; and after that having ſpread a Report that <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who had received a moſt powerful Reinforcement by his Fleet from <hi>Egypt,</hi> was about to attack <hi>Baruth,</hi> at the ſame time that he would alſo beſiege them in their Camp, he therefore proteſted that there was an abſolute Neceſſity that they ſhould march the next day to relieve that City. And accordingly marching out of his Quarter, with thoſe of his Party, to take that Way, he obliged the reſt of the Army inſtantly to raiſe the Siege and follow them, leaſt <hi>Saphadin,</hi> coming upon them, thus divided, with his whole Strength, they might fall into a worſe Diſaſter. Thus was Jeſus Chriſt, in his Intereſt, and the Reputation of his Religion, ſold to the <hi>Saraſins</hi> by theſe Traitors, as he had formerly been in his Perſon to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Judas.</hi> But as that Infamous received little Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by that ill gotten Money, and afterwards came to a deſerved End; ſo theſe perfidious Men gained little by their deteſtable Bargain, more than the Vexation and Shame to find that the Beſances, with which the crafty <hi>Saphadin</hi> had in ſuch profuſion paid them, were nothing but counterfeit Gold, which, ſo blinded were they at the receiving, as not to diſcover. And for the traiterous Biſhop of <hi>Wirtzbourg,</hi> returning ſome time after to his Biſhoprick, he was unluckily aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by ſome Officers of his Chapiter, with whom he had made a cruel War.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64918:126"/>Thus it is,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>After this Misfortune, a mighty Diviſion aroſe between the <hi>Orientals</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> who now began to perceive that they were betrayed, ſo that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Templers and Hoſpitallers, whom they left at <hi>Piolemais,</hi> reſolving to have nothing further to do with ſuch baſe and infamous Traitors, they drew off to <hi>Jaffa,</hi> to preſerve that place, which they had fortified, and to defend it againſt <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who threatned to beſiege it. And in truth, that Sultan, that he might make his Advantage of this Diſorder among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made them raiſe the Siege of <hi>Thoron,</hi> took that Reſolution, and came to Incamp in view of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> almoſt at the ſame time that the <hi>German</hi> Army arrived there. Now as it was very much weakned by the Fatigues of a long Siege, and by the Retreat of the <hi>Orientals,</hi> who had ſeparated from the <hi>Germans,</hi> they durſt not adventure upon a Battle, but ſatisfied themſelves with moleſting the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> by continual Skirmiſhes, wherein they generally had the Advantage. And particularly, one time having drawn the <hi>Saraſins</hi> into a great Ambuſcade which they had laid for them, they cut in pieces the greateſt part of their Army; but this coſt the Life of the brave Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was ſlain upon the Place, and of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who died the night following of a Wound which he received in Combating againſt the Lieutenant of <hi>Saphadin,</hi> whom he overthrew dead upon the Place with the ſtroak of his Lance.</p>
                  <p>Such a conſiderable Victory gave ſome room to hope that in a little time they might become Conquerors, and that they might happily Re-eſtabliſh the Affairs of the Eaſt; but the unhappy News which arrived while theſe Matters were in Agitation, from the Weſt, cauſed all theſe blooming Hopes to wither in a Moment, together with the Reinforcements which the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> expected; which obliged them inſtantly to return into <hi>Germany,</hi> where all was in a Flame of War, for the Reaſon which I am about to relate.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. who had ſo cruelly treated the <hi>Norman</hi> Princes in the Realms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> died a little before at <hi>Meſſina</hi> in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> of the preceeding Year, either with the Regret which he had to ſubmit to thoſe ſhameful Conditions impoſed upon him by the Empreſs <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi> his Wife, who with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> had ſurprized and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged him in a Caſtle, from whence it was impoſſible for him to eſcape; or as ſome ſuſpected, but with more malignity than Probability, of Poiſon, which that Princeſs, who for his proud and cruel Humor, hated him, had cauſed to be given him. Now he knowing that he had formerly been Excommunicated by the Pope for his unjuſt Impriſonment of <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> when he came to die he manifeſted great Sorrow for the ſame: He alſo ſent to that King, that ſo he might make him ſome ſort of Satisfaction, by the acknowledgment of his Offence; and by his laſt Will he obliged his Heirs to make Reſtitution of the Money which he had ſo unjuſtly exacted from him for his Ranſom, and in caſe of failure, he deſired the Pope to employ all his Power to ſee it performed. Great Weakneſs of Princes, who cannot reſolve to make Reſtitution while they live, of what they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unjuſtly poſſeſſed when they come to die; or to think they diſcharge themſelves ſufficiently by charging it upon their Succeſſors, who commonly are of the ſame Temper, and not troubled with theſe Sucruples till they come to die, where it is not very difficult to make fruitleſs Orders, which rarely oblige the Living, who may be ſuppoſed after their Example, will detain it as long as they live, and then only relinquiſh it, when they leave the World, and can hold it no longer.</p>
                  <p>This unhappy Prince died in the very prime of his Age, being about two and thirty Years old; and when he was upon the point of putting in Execution thoſe great Deſigns which he had formed againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, whom he had
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64918:126"/>compelled by the only Terror of his Armes and Name,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1198</label> to pay him a great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for the Provinces which <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> had formerly conquered from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and which they had recovered during the Troubles of <hi>Italy.</hi> He was of a middle Stature, having a weak Conſtitution, and a lean Body, his Face was handſome enough, but ſomething too Meagre, his Complexion was delicate and very fair, his Head not altogether large enough for the Proportion of the other parts of his Body, which were well made, and fit for all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, in which he was very dextrous, either on foot or horsback; he was an exceſſive lover of Hunting, Walking, and Field Sports, and therefore he choſe the Country rather than the City, for his uſual Reſidence, and it was very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that he repaired to the City, unleſs it were to ſhew his Magnificence in the Spectacles and publick Sports or Feſtivals, which he loved to make with great Magnificence, and even Vanity: This nevertheleſs did not in the leaſt hinder his applying himſelf to publick Affairs, or acting upon all Occaſions with abundance of Vigor, Prudence, and Reſolution; for he had a Spirit lively, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, cultivated by Study, and ſupported by an Eloquence Eaſy and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, a Judgment ſolid, a Soul great and enterprizing, and a Heart truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. But all theſe noble Qualities were diſhonoured by his Avarice, his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Injuſtice, his extreme Ambition, and above all, by his inſupportable Humor, his herce and inſatiable deſire of Revenge, and his barbarous Cruelty, which rendered him odious to his own Wife, by whom he held the Realms or <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which made her conſpire againſt him, thereby to ſtop the horrible Inundation of his Hatred and Fury. He left only one Son about three Years of Age, whoſe Name was <hi>Frederick,</hi> as was his Grandfather, and who afterwards was Emperor. He had cauſed him from his Cradle to be recogniſed for his Succeſſor to the Empire; but the Princes and Eſtates, notwithſtanding their Oath, being on one hand reſolved to have an Emperor, who was able to manage the publick Affairs, and on the other hand, not being able to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, upon whom to fix the Choiſe, there aroſe a moſt furious Schiſm among them, in which ſome of them choſe <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Suabia,</hi> Brother of the deceaſed Emperor, others elected <hi>Otho,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and both the one and the other took Arms to ſupport and defend their Emperor. This raiſed great Troubles and War, not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but all <hi>Europe,</hi> by the different Intereſts of the ſeveral Princes, who believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to joyn upon this Occaſion with each Party. <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> joyned with <hi>Otho</hi> his Nephew, the Son of his Siſter, to whom he had given the Earldome of <hi>Poitiers. Philip</hi> the Auguſt, who took the oppoſite part to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> declared himſelf for <hi>Philip;</hi> and the Pope on the contrary, who believed that the Houſe of <hi>Suabia,</hi> whoſe Princes had made War againſt the Holy See, ought to be humbled, employed all his pontifical Authority to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Otho</hi> againſt <hi>Philip;</hi> ſo that this unhappy Diviſion diſturbed the whole <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in conſequence ruined all the Hopes of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>For ſo ſoon as the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> who were in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> received an Account of this News, although after the Defeat of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> before <hi>Jaffa,</hi> they were upon the point of turning their victorious Arms againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> they inſtantly changed that Reſolution, and by common Conſent agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>Germany</hi> without any Delay, although the Pope writ to them in moſt preſſing Terms, conjuring them not to abandon the <hi>Holy Land</hi> to the <hi>Infidels;</hi> but the particular Lutereſt which every one of them had in one Party or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> prevailed above that of Chriſt Jeſus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed the Affairs of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who failed not to make Advantage of their Abſence, and in a ſhort time after their Departure, to recover <hi>Jaffa,</hi> and <hi>Baruth,</hi> and all the other Places which they had taken. Thus this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which was compoſed wholly of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, ſome few <hi>Italians</hi> only excepted, ſerved to no other Purpoſe but to manifeſt what hath in all Ages been too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and what we do too plainly know at this very day, that the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Empire, which hath robbed <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> of the greateſt part of the World, had hardly grown to that prodigious and unweildy Bulk, or even been able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt, had it not been for thoſe fatal Diviſions, which ſupport and ſtrengthen them by enfeebling the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that all their Power would not be able to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64918:127"/>reſiſt one of our Monarchs,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1198</label> had he nothing to fear either from the Ambition or the Jealouſy of his Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>But to comfort <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> for this Loſs, Providence raiſed up almoſt at the ſame time, a new Pope to unite all <hi>Europe</hi> in another general <hi>Cruſade,</hi> one part whereof made it moſt evidently apparent, that a few <hi>Chriſtians</hi> well united, and who have no occaſion to diſtruſt among themſelves, might eaſily make themſelves Maſters of the Capital City of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recover the Empire of the Eaſt. This great Pope was <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. who by an unanimous Conſent, and which is not commonly known in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, was choſen the ſame day that his Predeceſſor <hi>Celeſtin</hi> died, being the 8th. day of <hi>January;</hi> and that which increaſed the Wonder, was, that he was the youngeſt of all the Cardinals, having not yet ſeen more than thirty Years; and although the more Antient had taken mighty Pains to make their Parties, during the Indiſpoſition of the deceaſed Pope, yet the Succeſſion fell upon one leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. This Pope was of noble Extraction, being deſcended from the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe of the Counts <hi>de Signie;</hi> he was of juſt Proportion, and very well made, having an agreeable Aſpect, the Air of a great and generous Man, he had a Spirit ſubtle and clear, a prodigious Memory, a moſt ſolid Judgment, and a marvellous Vivacity, joyned with an indefatigable Diligence; which in a ſhort time rendred him one of the moſt knowing Men, that the Church ever had, in all ſort of Sciences, both Divine and Humane, all which he chiefly gained in the famous and learned Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he ſoon made himſelf be known and admired as the Honor and Ornament of the Age. And beſides all this, he had a Soul truly Great and Noble, naturally inclined to all thoſe Vertues which concur to the making one of the firſt Rank among Mankind, and particularly, great in the Church; for he was extreme Zealous, Vigilant and Active, always upon his Guard for the Defence of the Catholick Faith, and maintaining the Purity of its Principle, which is the Word of God, againſt the Attempts of Hereticks; which he made appear in a manner, which poſſibly will not be diſagreeable to be known, that ſo the Conduct of the Church at that time, in Affairs of that Importance, may be the better obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Metz,</hi> a knowing Prelate, and who carefully watched over his Flock, writ to him, <hi>That there ran about in his Dioceſs, a</hi> French <hi>Verſion of the New Teſtament, and of ſome Books of the Old, very Dangerous, and which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned great Diſorders; that thoſe who favoured and ſupported them were Laicks and Women, of whom the Number was very great, and who were ſo beſotted and blinded, that with the greateſt Obſtinacy they held their Erronious Opinions, and would by no means hearken to ſuch as indeavoured to reduce them to their Reaſon.</hi> And then he adds, <hi>Theſe People are arrived to thoſe Degrees of Inſolence, as openly to deride their Paſtors, who go about to prohibit the Reading of thoſe ill Tranſlations, pretending to prove the Lawfulneſs of them by the Holy Scriptures; and that they impudently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, with an incredible Confidence, that they would neither obey Biſhop, Archbiſhop, nor the Pope himſelf, though he ſhould, by a ſolemn Decree, condemn this Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they were reſolved never to forſake; and that ſtrangely deſpiſed, and with the utmoſt Contempt, treated all thoſe as ſimple and Ignorant, even the Prieſts, as well as others, who would not receive it as they did. Innocent,</hi> for the Remedy of this Diſorder, the dangerous Conſequences whereof he plainly ſaw, did not only Authorize what the Biſhop of <hi>Metz</hi> had done againſt this Tranſlation, but alſo nominated certain Commiſſaries, whom he aſſociated with him, to inform againſt the Authors and Favourers of this Diſorder, to cite them Canonically before their Tribunal, and there to Correct and paſs Sentence upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Appeal; commanding theſe Commiſſaries, with great Care and Diligence to put in Execution the Commands which they had received from the Holy See, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he in the Decretal, <hi>Herein the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is deeply Concern'd, and the Cauſe of the Catholick Faith lies at the Stake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This wondrous Pope, being ſuch as I have deſcribed, burning with a mighty Zeal for the good of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, was no ſooner ſetled in the Chair, but he began ſeriouſly to think of eſtabliſhing it in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it took its firſt Original: For this purpoſe, he did all that poſſibly could be done by his Letters, to ſtay the Princes of the <hi>German Cruſade</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64918:127"/>But when he ſaw the Revolution which had happened in the Empire had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called them all from thence,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1198</label> he endeavoured to make another general <hi>Cruſade</hi> in Deſpight of the Deviſions and Troubles which thoſe of the Empire had raiſed throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> For this purpoſe therefore he diſpatched his Legates to all places, with moſt preſſing Letters, by which he exhorted the Kings, the Princes, the Prelates, the Nobility and the People to take upon them the Croſs according to their Power, for the carrying on this Holy War, and to excite the whole World by his Example, and that of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and above all the Sacred College, he ordained that all the Clergy, who poſſeſſed the Goods of the Church, ſhould give the fortieth penny of their Revenue, and the Cardinals the tenth for the carrying on of this Holy War. Obliging himſelf in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to ſend conſiderable Summs of Money and ſtore of Proviſions for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and to raiſe Money for thoſe Expences, he cauſed all his Plate, both Gold and Silver to be melted down, and would be ſerved in nothing but earthen, Wooden, or Veſſels made of Glaſs. At the ſame time he ſent Cardinals to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Genoa</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> to exhort thoſe potent Republicks to rigg out their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as well to tranſport the <hi>Cruſades</hi> into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as to attack the <hi>Saraſins</hi> by Sea. He alſo took great care to pacifie the Troubles of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which hindred the Effect of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> there; and which Duke <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Youngeſt Son of the deceaſed King <hi>Bela,</hi> had raiſed in that Realm againſt <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother who ſucceeded to the Crown. But in regard the happy Succeſs of this <hi>Cruſade</hi> depended more eſpecially upon the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the two moſt potent Monarchies of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who were now engaged in a cruel War, he ſent the Cardinal <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi> his Legate, who negotiated ſo skilfully and with ſuch Succeſs between them, that at length at a Conference which they had at <hi>Andeli,</hi> they conſented to a Truce of five Years, in which time it was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Enterpriſe of the Holy War might be happily concluded. And in the mean time the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> was publiſhed in all Places but eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> where that Devout man <hi>Fouques de Nevilli</hi> preached it by order from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>This ſo famous man, who without Diſpute was one of the greateſt and moſt admirable Preachers that ever was, was Curate of <hi>Nevilli</hi> upon the <hi>Marne,</hi> not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of a great temporal Eſtate, but moſt Zealous for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls, which he endeavoured after, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing, with an incredible Fervency, that extraordinary Talent which he had received from God to preach his Holy word. This he did with all the Force imaginable, not only in his own Pariſh Church, but in all the adjacent Places, and eſpecially in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he declared himſelf the Implacable Enemy of all Vices, but above all of Uſury, and Impudicity, which occaſioned ſuch horrible diſorders in that time, which he reproved boldly, without fearing any perſon, and with all the Heat and Zeal which his Temperament, ardent and billious, could furniſh him with. God who at the Beginning of his Miniſtry, to elevate him by the Way of Humiliation, permitted him for two Years to toil and labour without any Fruit, whileſt preaching with all his Power againſt thoſe two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome mocking him, others wholly abandoning him, whileſt a third ſort, took occaſion outrageouſly to abuſe his Sermons, not any one ſeeming to reform, or be converted by all his preaching; inſomuch that he was juſt upon the point of quitting and giving over his preaching, deſpairing ever to do any good by it.</p>
                  <p>But God who was reſolved to make uſe of him, did ſo ſuddenly Change their Hearts and gave ſuch Power to his words, that piercing like flaming Darts into the moſt obdurate Hearts, they made ſuch a Prodigious Change upon the Manners of Men, that to aſtoniſhment all <hi>France</hi> ſeemed to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him; For he did not only aboliſh that Extravagant Extortion and unjuſt Uſury, which had ſo prevailed, that neither the Ordinances of the King, nor the Cenſures of the Church, had been able to repreſs; but he touched, the Hearts of the Uſurers ſo to the quick, that publickly deteſting their Crime, they made reſtitution of what they had gotten by this kind of Robbery, unto thoſe whom they had oppreſſed by thoſe horrid Extortions; and where they could not ſind thoſe to whom they ought to make Reparation, they came
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64918:128"/>drowned in Tears throwing themſelves at his Feet,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1198</label> and intreating him to take that unlawful Gain and deſtribute it among the Poor. That which added ſtill more Force and Efficacy to his Diſcourſes was, that it pleaſed God to beſtow upon him the Gift of Miracles, which he wrought in the Preſence of the whole World, either before or after his Preaching, curing all ſorts of Maladies and Infirmities, by the ſole Impoſition of his Hands. The Writers of thoſe times tell us of great Wonders which he did, and one among the reſt aſſures us that he durſt not recount all that he knew, in regard of the great Incredulity of Mankind: as for my own particular I believe that the greateſt Miracle which he did, was the clearing of <hi>Paris</hi> of thoſe Infamous Places, and the converting of ſo many lewd and debauched Women, ſome of which making the Vow of Chaſtity, ſilled the new Nunnery of St. <hi>Antonina,</hi> whic'h he ſounded for ſo pious a Deſign; others of them publickly promiſed for the Future to lead a moſt auſtere and penitent Life; and among the Young Women, many who diſtruſted their Courage and their Power, accepted the Favour which he offered, which was a handſome Portion, by the help whereof they eaſily paſſed from that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Condition wherein they were, into that of an honeſt and lawful Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>For this Purpoſe he procured mighty Contributions, even the Schollars of the Univerſity raiſing for him five hundred Livres in Silver, and the Burgers of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in a Body, not reckoning the Particular Benefactions, adding above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more, which was a very extraordinary Summ for thoſe times. So many Wonders, which his Renown publiſhed of this admirable Preacher, cauſed the Biſhops to invite him into their Dioceſſes, where he was received with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reſpect, the People and Clergy flocking to him as if he had been an Angel ſent from Heaven. The good man did not hereupon grow proud and vain, or diſtinguiſhed himſelf by any fooliſh Affectation; for he always went according to his Cuſtom on Horſeback, decently habited like a man of his Profeſſion; he kept his Beard ſhavenaccording to the Cuſtom of that Age; his Diet, which he always received with Benediction and giving of Thanks, was indifferently what was offered him; neither did there appear any thing ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, either in his Perſon or in his manner of Living; ſo that his preaching and his Miracles always produced good Effects, wherever he came, excepting in two Places in <hi>Normandy</hi> where he was very ill treated. For coming to <hi>Lizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux,</hi> and taking upon him with his uſual Liberty and Vehemence to reprove the Diſorders of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> who were very irregular, they made him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but without being able to abridge him, even in his Fetters, of the Fredom, which he took to reprehend them; ſo that being aſhamed to detain him, after they were a little recovered from the Brutal Tranſport, they ſet him again at Liberty. After which, as he preached at <hi>Caen,</hi> doing his uſual Wonders before the People, The Governor of the Caſtle, thinking he ſhould do the King of <hi>England</hi> a great pleaſure, the good man having been very liberal in reproving his Debauches, committed him to Priſon, from whence, being in a marvellous way delivered, according to the Command of the Goſpel, he ſhook off the duſt of his Feet againſt them, and continued his preaching conſtantly to other Cities, till ſuch time as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> being well imformed of the Vertue and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Talent, which this marvellous man had in preaching, he appointed him by his <hi>Breve</hi> bearing Date <hi>November</hi> the fifth in the Year 1198, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the <hi>Cruſade</hi> with all its Indulgences and prerogatives throughout all <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime after underſtanding that the Abbots of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Order held their general Chapiter, being accompanied with abundance of his Diſciples, he there ſolemnly took upon him the Croſs, as did alſo at the ſame time, <hi>Garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Langreſs,</hi> poſſibly to put himſelf into good Terms with the Pope, who was not over well ſatisfied with him for his Conduct. After which he made his Supplication to the Aſſembly, that ſince there were met there ſo many Abbots, famous for their Learning and their Vertue, they would be pleaſed to appoint ſome one of their Number, who might ſhare with him in this glorious Employ for the Service of Jeſus Chriſt and his Religion by aſſiſting him in preaching the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and accompanying him in this Holy Voyage. But he could
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64918:128"/>not meet with a Gratification, in his Requeſt, it may be,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1199</label> becauſe the Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already given Commiſſion to ſome Abbots of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Order to preach the <hi>Cruſade</hi> in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> they did not judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to draw any more of their Abbots from their Charges to employ them in this Miniſtry. So that <hi>Fouques</hi> departed from the Aſſembly, and was ſcarce got out of the Gate of the Monaſtry, where an Infinite Number of People were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon the Report of the Arrival of this Holy Man; but he began to preach up the Croſs with ſo much fervency and Eloquence, that all of them indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged themſelves to take it upon them. After which having made choice of one among his Diſciples, who was moſt capable to ſecond him in this Exerciſe of preaching, he travailed over almoſt all <hi>France,</hi> where an infinite Number of Perſons of all ſorts and Conditions took upon them the Croſs, whileſt <hi>Herloin,</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> a very able and knowing man, and well acquainted in the lower <hi>Bretanie</hi> did the ſame in all that Country; and that thoſe whom the Pope had commiſſioned to publiſh the <hi>Cruſade</hi> in <hi>England</hi> proceeded there alſo with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>For King <hi>Richard,</hi> who ever ſince his return from the <hi>Holy Land</hi> wore the Croſs, as a mark of his Reſolution to return thither, made a moſt Magniſicent Entertainment at <hi>London,</hi> where the greateſt part of the Gentlemen, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither to gain Honour in the Tilts and Tournaments which were held there, engaged themſelves after his Example to combat more nobly againſt the <hi>Saraſins</hi> for the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt. But whether this was done in reallity, this Prince having an Intention to go once more to <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> or that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Appearance, and to ingratiate himſelf with the Pope, that ſo he might fix him to the Intereſts of his Nephew <hi>Otho,</hi> and aſſure his Pretenſions to the Empire is very uncertain, but let it be which of them ſoever, there preſently after happened an Accident which put an end to his Intentions and Deſigns; For having underſtood that the <hi>Poitouins</hi> were revolted from him, he paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with an Army ſo ſuddenly, that by his only Preſence he repreſſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; but though he knew how to overcome his Enemies, yet he was not ſo happy in conquering his Paſſions, and his Natural Temerity, inſtigated by the Rebelious Vice of Covetouſneſs, brought this brave Prince to an untimely Grave, when his Affairs were in the moſt flouriſhing and proſperous Condition. For <hi>Vinomare,</hi> Vicount of <hi>Limoges,</hi> having found a mighty Treaſure in ſome of his Lands, offered him one half, provided he might poſſeſs the other himſelf. But King <hi>Richard,</hi> who inordinately doated upon Money, reſolved to have it all, alledging that the Treaſure of right appertained to the Lord of the Fee; and upon the Vicounts refuſal, he preſently laid Siege to the Caſtle of <hi>Chalus,</hi> where he imagined the Treaſure was kept. So ſoon as thoſe of the Garriſon ſaw their Prince in Perſon before the Place; fearing to fall into his Hands, they offered to ſurrender the place provided they might be permitted to march out of it honourably, and with their Arms; but this ſierce Prince to diſcourage them commanded it to be ſignified to them, that he did not uſe to capitulate with his Subjects, that he was reſolved to take the Place by Force, and to hang every one of them who had dared to oppoſe him; This terrible Menace, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe poor people to Deſpair, and that Deſpair begat in them a Courage and Reſolution to defend themſelves to the laſt: Whereupon this Prince, whoſe Heart was always a Stranger to fear, coming to take a View of the place in order to attack it, and approaching too near, one <hi>Bertrand Gourdon,</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officer of the Garriſon, knowing him, took ſo true aim at him, that he ſhot him out of a Croſs-Bow with a barbed Arrow, through the left hand and a little under his Shoulder; the King inraged with the Wound cauſed the Place to be ſo furiouſly ſtormed night and day without Intermiſſion, that according to his Deſire it was at laſt carried by Aſſault; after which he cauſed all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers who defended it to be hanged, <hi>Gourdon</hi> only excepted who had wounded him, and whom after his recovery, he reſolved to put to death by the moſt cruel Puniſhments: But it was in vain that he promiſed himſelf Health and Revenge. For the Chirurgeon, who when he attempted to draw out the Arrow left the Head behind, being an unskilful Bungler, made ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cruel and dangerous Inciſions, that the Wound Gangreen'd, and the Cure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

He died in the Arms of <hi>Gautier</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> with ſo many Sentiments and Marks of true Repentance, as one ſhall rarely find greater among the moſt celebrated Saints. So rigorouſly did he permit himſelf to be treated in thoſe Extremities of his Life, that, by his Patience and Submiſſion, he might in ſome manner attone the Divine Juſtice, by offering to God the Sacrifice of a Heart perfectly and truly humble and contrite, and a Body mortified by the ſevere Pains which he endured, beſides thoſe which he ſuffered by his Wound.</p>
                  <p>A little before his Death he cauſed <hi>Gourdon,</hi> who had given him the mortal Wound, to be brought into his Preſence; and calmly demanded of him, <hi>Why he had endeavoured to take away his Life? It is,</hi> replied he ſiercely, and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſlain my Father and my two Brothers; becauſe thou didſt reſalve, by the ignominious Halter, to take away my Life; and becauſe thou haſt done an inſinite deal of Miſchief in the World. And after this, there is nothing that thou canst do to me which I fear: And ſince I am aſſured of thy Death, I ſhall, with Joy, be ready to receive my own, though it comes accompanied with all the Terrors and cruel Torments that can be inſlicted on me. And I,</hi> replied the King immediately, <hi>will, for the Love of God, that thou ſhalt live.</hi> And thereupon he cauſed him preſently to be ſet at liberty, commanding that an hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, and ſtraitly prohibiting all his People to do him any Injury. But preſently after the death of the King, the Lieutenant General of his Army cauſing him to be ſeized, made him be hanged and roaſted alive, in a moſt barbarous and horrible manner. At his Death, the King commanded a good part of his Treaſure to be diſtributed among his Domeſticks, and the Poor. He ordered that his Body ſhould be interred at <hi>Fontevraud,</hi> at the Feet of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it were, to make ſome honourable Reparation, by this little Humility at his Death, for the ill Treatment which he had given him during his Life: He bequeathed his Heart to the Church of our Lady at <hi>Roan,</hi> which he had always particularly cheriſhed: And for his Soul, he entirely ſubmitted it to the Divine Juſtice; offering himſelf, after ſuch an exemplary Repentance, to ſuffer the Pains of Purgatory, even till the Day of Judgment, for the Expiation of his Crimes.</p>
                  <p>It is not my Province to judge of what it pleaſeth God to determine and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; but this is certain, that three and thirty Years after his Death, <hi>Henry</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> preaching, after he had given holy Orders, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> before the <hi>Paſſion-Sunday,</hi> on which Day the Church begins the Service with thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah, Ho! Every one that thirſteth, come to the Waters, ſaith the Lord; Come and drink with Joy:</hi> In the midſt of his Sermon, as if it had been by a ſuddain Enthuſiaſm, he cried out, <hi>Rejoyce, my Brethren, the Soul of the glorious King</hi> Richard, <hi>after having, till this time, been purified like Gold in the Furnace, is now paſſed into Heaven.</hi> And he affirmed it with ſuch an aſſured Air, expoſing to every Perſon all the Circumſtances of the Revelation which he pretended to have had, that the Authority of a Prelate, who was known to be a moſt vertuous and learned Man, and who was never accuſed for a Viſionary, made very many wiſe People believe, that, without Weakneſs, they might give Credit to it. However it be, it is not ſo much upon theſe ſort of Revelations, which are liable to be doubted, as upon the manner of the Death of this great Prince, that one may reaſonably found a Belief of his Salvation. However, I thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe edifying Particularities of the Death of this King, who had ſo great a Share in theſe <hi>Cruſades;</hi> that ſo Princes may underſtand, that when they have had the happineſs to render unto God any conſiderable Service by any Heroick Action, as did this King <hi>Richard,</hi> in being the firſt that took upon him the Croſs in this Holy War, where he performed ſo many brave things, they have great reaſon to hope that the Divine Goodneſs, which is never ſlow in rewarding the meaneſt Services, will recompenſe them by the greateſt of all Favours, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe to die well, who have employed their Lives in his Service, and for his Glory.</p>

Theſe two Princes were <hi>Theobald</hi> IV. Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who died by the unfortunate Accident at <hi>Ptolemais;</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> his Conſin-german, Count <hi>de Blois</hi> and <hi>Chartres,</hi> both of them nearly related to <hi>I hilip</hi> the Auguſt, both by the Father and the Mother. They were both young, and both paſſionate of Glory. And <hi>Theobald,</hi> who was a magnificent Prince, that he might declare himſelf with more Splendor, and draw after him more Perſons of Quality, publiſhed a Tournament to be held at his Caſtle of <hi>Eſcri,</hi> upon the River <hi>Aiſne,</hi> in <hi>Advent</hi> of that Year 1199. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the principal Gentry of the Neighbouring Provinces aſſembled themſelves, to be Sharers in thoſe Manly Exerciſes. There it was that the brave Count <hi>Theobald,</hi> amidſt thoſe noble Exerciſes of Chivalry, which the <hi>French,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Counts <hi>de Champagne,</hi> have always ſo much delighted in; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to paſs magnificently, from that gallant Repreſentation of War, to that true and holy War which he was about to undertake, in moſt ſolemn manner took upon him the Croſs, together with the Count <hi>de Blois,</hi> his Couſin. They were immediately followed by two Lords of extraordinary Merit, and high Reputation; the famous <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Renaud de Montmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rail,</hi> the Couſin of Count <hi>Lewis.</hi> After which, all thoſe who were under any particular Obligation to theſe two Counts, and many other Gentlemen and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, eſpecially of the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>Picardy,</hi> alſo followed their Example, and took upon them the Croſs. The principal among theſe new Champions of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Names are moſt known, and which I mention in this place, reſerving my ſelf to ſpeak of the others upon occaſion of their brave Actions, were <hi>Geoffry de Joinville,</hi> Steward, and <hi>Geoffry de Ville Hardouin,</hi> Mareſhal of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who, like a frank and generous Cavalier, hath obliged Poſterity with the Hiſtory of this War; the Counts <hi>Gautier,</hi> and <hi>John de Brienne, Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier de Vignori, William</hi> and <hi>Villain de Neully, Erard de Montigni, Manaſſes de l' Iſle, Guy de Chappes, Renard de Dampierre, Oliver de Rochefort, Ives de Laval, Anſelme de Courſelles, Henry de Montreil, Paien d'Orleans, Matthew de Montmorenci, Guy de Couci, Robert de Malvoiſin, Enguerrand, Hugh</hi> and <hi>Robert de Boves,</hi> Counts <hi>d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens;</hi> to whom, the Year following, joyned the Counts <hi>Hugh de</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de Bologne,</hi> and <hi>Geoffry de Perche,</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> his Brother; with divers other Lords which followed them. And to take care of the ſpiritual Militia of this Army deſigned for a Holy War, <hi>Garnier</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troies,</hi> who had taken the Croſs the Year before, and <hi>Nevelon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> reſolved to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this <hi>Cruſade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such a famous Action, which could not fail of making a mighty noiſe in the World, was the Parent of others, great Examples being commonly very proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which were produced thereby in generous Minds, and Hearts, which were amorous of Glory.

The ſix Deputies having debated an Affair of this Importance, found that, to ſecure themſelves from thoſe terrible Inconveniences which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Armies had ſuffered in the firſt <hi>Cruſades,</hi> by long and hazardous Land-Marches, it was much more convenient to take the Paſſage of the Sea; and, that the Paſſage might be ſhort and commodious, with ſo much Proviſion, and ſo many Ships, as was neceſſary for the tranſporting of ſo great an Army, either into <hi>Syria</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> there could not be any way more proper than to treat with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, without all Contradiction, were at that time, the People, of all <hi>Europe,</hi> the moſt powerful upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. This Advice therefore being approved of by the Princes,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1201</label> the Deputies repaired to <hi>Venice</hi> in the Beginning of the following Year 1201. where, in a few days, they negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt ſucceſsfully with the famous <hi>Henry Dandolo,</hi> who, for nine Years paſt, had been the Doge of that flouriſhing Republick.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Henry</hi> was a Prince of a great and Majeſtick Port; and being now above fourſcore Years old, though, to a Miracle, neither decrepit in Body, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in Mind, his great Age rendred him ſtill more Auguſt and venerable; he had Prudence, the conſummated Effect of long Experience, a moſt invincible Courage, and an immovable Firmneſs in ſuch Reſolutions as he took for the Good of his Country, of which he was a moſt paſſionate Lover. He was a great Captain, and a valiant Soldier, an able Politician, and, even at thoſe Years, wonderfully taken with the fair Image of Glory. Above all, he was the moſt dexterous Manager of Affairs; and though he were almoſt blind, not ſo much by the Decay of Nature, as the Effect of Cruelty, yet was he the cleareſt ſighted Man of his time in Matters of State. The Occaſion of the Loſs of his Sight was this, About fifty Years before, being employed from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, as their Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he generouſly ſuſtained his Character, and ſtoutly maintained the Intereſts of his Country; the perfidious Emperor <hi>Manuel,</hi> not able to bear that Freedom, cauſed a red hot Plate of Iron to be held before his Eyes, to put them out: But for all this barbarous Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, whereby he violated the Law of Nations, though his Sight was mightily impaired, yet it was not wholly loſt; nor did his Eyes loſe any thing, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, of their Luſtre and Clearneſs, till, after this, he received an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Blow upon his Head at the Seige of <hi>Zara,</hi> which, if it did not altogether take away his Sight, yet left him but a very little. Notwithſtanding which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Duke acted with more Application, or better Succeſs, for the Intereſts of <hi>Venice,</hi> where his well known Merit gained him an univerſal Reſpect, and gave him more Authority and Power than either his Charge or Dignity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at that time the Power was far more unlimited than it hath been ſince, by the Laws which that ſage Republick hath enacted, to abridge the Authority of its Head.</p>
                  <p>It was then with this great Man, that the Deputies immediately treated in his private Council, which was compoſed of ſix Senators; and they managed their Negotiation with that frankneſs, remitting themſelves wholly to him for what they muſt give the Republick for the Aſſiſtance which they deſired from them, that in eight days they came to agree upon the Conditions of the Treaty, which were theſe; <hi>That the</hi> Venetians <hi>ſhould furniſh them with flat bottom'd Boats and Ships, either to paſs into</hi> Syria <hi>or</hi> Egypt, <hi>for four thouſand five hundred Knights with their Horſes, nine thouſand Eſquires, and twenty thouſand Foot, with ſo much Munitions and Proviſions which ſhould ſuffice this Fleet for a Year. That all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſhould be rigged and ready to ſail in the Month of</hi> June <hi>following, and ſhould ſerve them for one Year, accounting from the Day that the Fleet ſhould part from the Port of</hi> Venice. <hi>That the Princes of the</hi> Cruſade <hi>ſhould pay for the ſame eighty five thouſand
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64918:130"/>Marks in Silver; which, according to the true Supputation,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1201</label> is about eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns</hi> French <hi>Money, which was a very extraordinary Sum in thoſe times.</hi> But the Doge, who had a great Soul, being reſolved that it ſhould not be ſaid that the <hi>Venetians</hi> acted juſt like Merchants, in furniſhing Ships and Proviſions at a reaſonable Rate; having beſides, a great deſire to ſignalize himſelf upon this Occaſion, and to have a ſhare in the Glory which was to be acquired in this War; therefore acquainted them, that the Republick, to contribute to ſuch a holy Enterpriſe, was reſolved to joyn with them at the leaſt fifty Gallies, well rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and armed, with ſo many Soldiers as were neceſſary to ſerve profitably by Sea at the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> acted by Land; and that they ſhould equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part betwixt them the Conqueſts which ſhould be made during the time of their Confederation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dandolo</hi> having eaſily brought the great Council of forty Senators to approve of the Treaty, as alſo the three other Aſſemblies of the Notables of the City, judged that it was convenient to have it ratified by the People, whom, to the number of above ten thouſand, he cauſed to be aſſembled in the place, and the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> where, after the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt had been ſung, the ſix Deputies being introduced, as before had been agreed with the Doge, <hi>Geoſſry</hi> Mareſhal of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who ſpoke for his Collegues, delivered himſelf in few, but very moving Words, to the Senate and People, after this manner; <hi>That the moſt powerful Princes of</hi> France <hi>having ſolemnly devoted themſelves to the Service of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Deliverance of his Holy Sepulchre, and Holy City, which groaned under the Tyranny of the</hi> Inſidels, <hi>had, among all the People of</hi> Europe, <hi>made choice of the</hi> Venetians, <hi>as the moſt potent and generous, the moſt capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in ſuch a glorious Enterpriſe, to deſire their Aſſiſtance, and the Conjunction of their Forces; without which, they had no hope ever to re-conquer the holy City of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. <hi>And for this purpoſe,</hi> added he, with a very odd and ſurprizing Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>as on the one hand they are reſolved to undertake this Conquest; and on the other, that they are fully ſatisfied, that without your Aſſiſtance it is impoſſible to ſucceed, they have therefore given us in Commiſſion, to uſe no other Arguments to perſuade you, but to prostrate our ſelves at your Feet, with a Proteſtation that we will never riſe from thence, till you have agreed to our Deſires, and to ſuch Conditions as you ſhall judge fit to preſcribe.</hi> And thereupon they fell upon their Knees, and without ſaying any thing further, with their Hands extended to the Aſſembly in the poſture of Suppliants, by that piteous Geſture, accompanied with Sighs and Groans, they moved them much more than they could have done by the moſt Rhetorical and paſſionate Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>And here it is that we muſt be forced to acknowledge, that our Anceſtors had a great Stock of a certain frank and generous Goodneſs, which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, which have been much refined upon the point of Honour, would be far from ſubmitting to, or imitating, upon a like Occaſion. But though they did not ſo exactly obſerve all the Meaſures and Punctilioes of Breeding, which at this day are with ſo much Nicity and Scruple obſerved, for the maintaining of the Dignity which is owing to the Character of Ambaſſadors, yet they had this Advantage, that many times they accompliſhed that in a Moment, which now coſts whole Years of tedious Negotiations; which, when they are finiſhed, are yet ſcarely to be conſided in. This Action, which the Envoy of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would ſcarce be perſuaded to now, had ſuch an Effect upon all this great Aſſembly, that the Doge, the Senate and the People raiſing them up immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that beſeeching Poſture, as it were, by Conſent, all together lifting up their Hands, and their Eyes, drowned in Tears of Compaſſion, cried out with one Voice, <hi>We will, We will;</hi> making the Church, the Palace and the great Place reſound with their repeated Echoes, which inſtantly ran chearfully to the City, where they were ſo redoubled, that they made the very Arched Roof of Heaven ring; and embracing the Deputies, they proteſted that they would employ their Lives and Fortunes with theſe generous <hi>French</hi> Princes, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Jeſus Chriſt in his Inheritance, and his Empire, which had been invaded by his Enemies. After which, the Treaty, which to this day remains in the Archives of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> together with the Confirmation of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> being ratified by all the Orders of the Republick, and ſigned by both Parties,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64918:131"/>with an Oath upon the Holy Evangeliſts,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1201</label> that it ſhould be moſt inviolably kept, maintained and obſerved, the Deputies returned into <hi>France,</hi> where the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Champagne</hi> found the Count, his Maſter, ſick of the Diſtemper of which in a few days after he died moſt religiouſly, in the very Flower of his Youth, being aged but twenty five Years, having, upon his Death-bed, appointed Count <hi>Renaud de Dampierre</hi> to be his Subſtitute, and in his Name to take the Voyage with the Troops which he put under his Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Now the Count <hi>de Champagne</hi> having been choſen Head of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> there was a neceſſity of putting another in his place. For this purpoſe the Princes concerned, after that <hi>Eudes</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> Count <hi>de Bar,</hi> the Couſin of the deceaſed Count, to whom this Honour was offered, had excuſed themſelves, by reaſon that they were not inclined to engage in this Voyage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſome to offer it to <hi>Boniface</hi> Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> Brother to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Marquis <hi>Conrade</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who had acquired ſo much Honour by the glorious Actions which he performed in the third <hi>Cruſade.</hi> He willingly accepted of the Honour which was done him, hoping thereby to gain Glory to himſelf, by being employed to procure that of Jeſus Chriſt.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> was yet more happy, in that a little time after, God was pleaſed to call him to receive the Recompence of ſo many Labours, it being not his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pleaſure to make further uſe of his Miniſtry than he did that of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> to aſſemble the Army of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> but not to accompany them, much leſs conduct them to the Wars; where Prieſts, if they act regularly, and contain themſelves within the Bounds of their Profeſſion, according to God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to make uſe of no other Arms but Prayers, nor to combat otherwiſe than <hi>Moſes</hi> did againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> by lifting up their Hands to Heaven. This holy Man died of the Diſeaſe in his Pariſh of <hi>Nevilli,</hi> where he was making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for his Voyage. He appointed by his laſt Will, that all the Money, which he had collected from the Charity of well diſpoſed People, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> Thus died this devout Preacher, to whoſe Memory, the Church, at this day, renders great Honours; and who deſerved, for his Piety, to be eternally reverenced by all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>In this time the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> having made their Preparations during the Winter, about <hi>Whitſunday</hi> put themſelves upon their March towards <hi>Venice,</hi> where an untoward Adventure, which they could not poſſibly foreſee, had like to have ruined the whole Enterpriſe, juſt upon its firſt beginning. For on one part, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſo exactly performed their part of the Treaty, that there were more Ships rigged, and furniſhed with all things neceſſary, than was needful for the Tranſporting and Entertainment of the Army after their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarkment, beſides the fifty Gallies well armed, which they had furniſhed at their own Charge; ſo that it was but reaſonable that the <hi>French,</hi> according to their Stipulation, ſhould, before their ſetting out, pay ſo much of the Money as they were obliged to do. But on the other ſide, a great number of the Lords, who had promiſed to repair to <hi>Venice,</hi> in order to their Tranſportation, had changed their Reſolution, and went to embark at <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> as did the Biſhop of <hi>Autun,</hi> and the <hi>Burgundians, John de Nele, Chastelain</hi> of <hi>Bourges, Nicholas de Mailli,</hi> and <hi>Thierri,</hi> the Couſin of <hi>Baldwin,</hi> with whom that Count had intruſted the Fleet which he had equipped in <hi>Flanders:</hi> And others of them in the Ports of <hi>Pavia;</hi> among which, the brave <hi>William de Nevilli, Henry de Longchamp,</hi> and <hi>Renaud de Dampierre,</hi> General of the Troops of <hi>Champagne;</hi> either becauſe they believed that the Paſſage would be ſhorter, and leſs dangerous that way, than to embark at <hi>Venice;</hi> or that they had ſome Diſtruſt and Jealouſie of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> or, which is moſt probable, that they thought they ſhould thereby be exempted from paying their <hi>Quota</hi> of ſo great a Sum of Money as was promiſed to be paid to that Republick. Inſomuch, that there being a great number of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64918:131"/>thoſe who ought to have contributed to the Charge, drawn off,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> and that many of thoſe who were preſent were not able, or rather, not willing to pay more than their firſt Proportion; being inwardly pleaſed to think that the Army would, by this Accident, be broken, and they ſhould be at liberty to return, it was abſolutely impoſſible for the Princes to raiſe the Sum which they ought to pay for the Re-imburſment of the <hi>Venetians:</hi> So that, after they had generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above what was their Part, given all that they had in Gold, Silver and Jewels, they ſtill found themſelves in Arrear thirty four thouſand of the eighty five thouſand Marks, which they were, by Contract, obliged to pay. Thus this noble Enterpriſe, which was ſo happily begun, ran the danger of being ſhipwrack'd, even in the Port where it was to be imbarked. But the Doge, who was a mighty Politician, made his Advantage of this Accident to ſerve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, by furniſhing the Princes, who extreamly deſired it, with an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of diſ-engaging themſelves from the trouble and perplexity of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Accident.</p>
                  <p>For, after he had communicated his Deſign to the Senate, who approved it as a moſt ſuitable Expedient to ſecure both their Honour and their Intereſt; and alſo to purchaſe them a conſiderable Advantage; he went to the Princes, and offered to give them time for the Payment of the reſidue of their Debt, till ſuch time as the Holy War ſhould be happily accompliſhed by their Conqueſts, provided they would preſently joyn with the <hi>Venetians</hi> for the recovering of <hi>Zara,</hi> a ſtrong and potent City in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> which having revolted four or five times from them, had, about three Years before, put it ſelf into the Power of the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> There were a great many who ſtoutly oppoſed this Propoſition; ſome out of a ſecret Malignity of Spirit, and a deſire they had to ſee the Army disbanded; others, on the contrary, by the eager deſire which they had to go immediately to the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> amongſt whom, the hotteſt were ſome Abbots of the <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Order, as the Abbot <hi>du Val de Sernay,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Trappe,</hi> and a <hi>German,</hi> named <hi>Martin Litz,</hi> Abbot of a Monaſtery in <hi>Alſatia;</hi> who, after he had, by the Order of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Cruſade</hi> about <hi>Baſte,</hi> after the Example of <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite, had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of an Army of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and conducting them by <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> a little before this Accident fell out. Great Diſputes there were upon this Subject, and the Reaſons which were urged on one ſide and the other were very plauſible: Thoſe who were againſt it alledged, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its being a moſt deteſtable thing for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who had taken upon them the Croſs, to turn thoſe Arms which they had taken up againſt <hi>Infidels,</hi> upon their Brethren, by making War againſt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King; it was a known thing, that the <hi>Bulla</hi> of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> declared all thoſe Excommunicate, who ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, during the Holy War, againſt the <hi>Cruſades;</hi> and that none could be ignorant, that the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was in poſſeſſion of <hi>Zara,</hi> had taken upon him the Croſs, and was making Preparation to paſs into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, in truth, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> fearing that they would undertake this Siege, had, a little before, ſent Cardinal <hi>Peter de Capua</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> to oppoſe that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and expreſly to forbid the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> under pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> to engage therein. But on the other part, <hi>Henry Dandolo,</hi> the Doge, remonſtrated, <hi>That theſe Lightnings of</hi> Rome <hi>were not diſcharged, but againſt ſuch as went about to make any Advantage of the Abſence of the</hi> Cruſades, <hi>and thereby unjuſtly to raviſh from them their Eſtates; and that they were not deſigned againſt ſuch as, purſuing that natural Right wherewith God had inveſted them, and which it was not in the power of any Pope to take from private Perſons, much leſs from Soveraigns, deſigned only to recover their own Eſtates, to reduce their Rebels to Obedience, and to conſtrain thoſe who ſupported them to leave them to the Juſtice and the Clemency of their Maſters. That if this were not allowed to be Truth, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that a thing ſo ſacred as the</hi> Cruſade, <hi>muſt be the Cauſe of all manner of Injuſtice, by favouring, and giving Protection to Thieves, Robbers, Revolters, Rebels and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers; to whom the Popes, by virtue of their</hi> Bulla's, <hi>under pretext of the Holy War, muſt give the Opportunity to glory in their Crimes, and to confirm themſelves in their Revolts and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations. That the Authority of the Church extending it ſelf only to things purely ſpiritual, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64918:132"/>to it by Jeſus Chriſt,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> whoſe Kingdom, as he declares, is not of this World, could not undertake to be the Arbiter either of Peace or War, which Princes make, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they judge it conducive to the publick Good, and their own Intereſt. That therefore the Church had nothing to do in this Caſe, or to hinder them from taking Arms againſt the</hi> Zarantines, <hi>who, beſides that they were Rebels, were alſo, by their continual Piracies, and deſtroying Commerce, publick Enemies to Mankind, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Enemies to the</hi> Cruſades, <hi>whoſe Paſſage into</hi> Paleſtine <hi>by Sea, as that of their Proviſions, they made very unſecure and dangerous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as theſe Reaſons, both on the one ſide and the other, appeared very ſtrong, it was a long time before any Reſolution could be taken; and in that time, many of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were come thither under the Conduct of the Abbot <hi>Martin,</hi> having conſumed what they brought with them for their Voyage, and divers others of the more Wealthy, reſolving not to make War againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> took occaſion to return back into their own Countries. But at length, the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> ſuffered themſelves to be perſuaded by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Doge, which made a ſtrong Impreſſion upon their Spirits, to which the neceſſity to which they found themſelves reduced, either to joyn with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or give over the Enterpriſe, contributed not a little towards the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing this Agreement. Nevertheleſs, it was made with this Condition, that after the Taking of <hi>Zara,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould joyn their Forces with them in order to the attacking of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Conqueſt whereof they hoped would not be difficult, which, by reaſon of the Famine and the Peſtilence, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly deſolated for five Years, in which it had wanted the Inundation of the River <hi>Nilus. Dandolo</hi> raviſhed with Joy to have obtained what he ſo earneſtly deſired, upon this Occaſion, did an Action which was wholly unexpected from him, and by which he moſt juſtly acquired immortal Fame: For, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his extream Old Age, and the Weakneſs, and, in a manner, entire Loſs of his Sight, which might well have diſpenſed him from going to the Wars; yet one Day, in a great Aſſembly of the Senate, the Lords of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and the People, being in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> he unexpectedly mounted the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and earneſtly intreated the Republick to give him permiſſion to take upon him the Croſs, and in Perſon to conduct the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army; and that, leaving his Son to ſupply his place, after the Taking of <hi>Zara,</hi> he might accompany the brave and generous Princes of <hi>France,</hi> either to partake with them in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of delivering the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, or to die with them in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſuch a glorious Enterpriſe. Theſe Words were received both by the <hi>Cruſades</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> with mighty Applauſe, and with ſuch great Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, mingled with Tears and Cries of Joy, that the venerable old Prince, more encouraged by the general Conſent, and the glorious Teſtimonies which were rendred to his Vertue, deſcending inſtantly from the Tribunal, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be conducted to the Foot of the Altar, where, proſtrating himſelf to offer his Life as a Sacrifice to Almighty God, to whoſe Service he now d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>An Example ſo illuſtrious was preſently followed by ſeveral of the principal Perſons of the Republick. And that which augmented the Joy was, that at the ſame time there was ſeen to arrive a noble Troop of brave <hi>German</hi> Lords and <hi>Brabamers,</hi> who had taken upon them the Croſs, with <hi>Conrade</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſtad,</hi> and <hi>Berthold</hi> Count <hi>de Catzenelbogen.</hi> So that by the favour of theſe Reinforcements, the Army found it ſelf compleat, and being all imbarked, in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> they parted from the Port of <hi>Venice</hi> upon the gallanteſt Fleet which had ever ſpread Canvas upon thoſe Seas, and which conſiſted in three hundred Veſſels charged with all manner of Warlike Engines and Munitions. Upon the Eve of St. <hi>Martin</hi> they came within view of <hi>Zara;</hi> and though, conſidering the heighth and thickneſs of the Walls, and the ſtrength of its Towers, which were defended by a ſtrong Garriſon, many of thoſe who beheld it at a diſtance judged it impregnable, yet the next Day they attacked the Port with ſo much Fury, that having diſperſed thoſe who defended it with the mighty force of Stones and Darts from the Engines, and having broken the Chain which defended it,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64918:132"/>they gained it by main Force, and landed on the other Shoar,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> there to attack the City, ſo ſoon as they had made their Lodgments, and taken up their ſeveral Poſts. This vigorous Attempt did ſo terrify the Beſieged, that the next Day they ſent out Deputies, to make Offers of Surrendring the City upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of only having their Lives ſaved. And they had moſt infallibly done it, if thoſe of the Cabal, who before had indeavoured to break up the Army, had not by a moſt baſe Perfidiouſneſs, altered their Reſolution, by aſſuring them, that they had none to deal with but the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for that the <hi>French,</hi> in Obedience to the Pope, were reſolved to undertake nothing againſt them. At the ſame time <hi>Guy,</hi> Abbot <hi>du Val de Sernay,</hi> the ſame Perſon who had done ſuch great Things againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and who was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> went to ſpeak with the Doge and the reſt of the Princes; and by a Zeal, which had like to have cauſed great Diſorders, certainly a Zeal which made him act very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, by unneceſſarily expoſing to Contempt the Authority of the Holy See, he forbad them, in behalf of the Pope, to proceed any further, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe any thing againſt <hi>Zara,</hi> declaring thoſe who ſhould diſobey this Order, to be Excommunicate by Virtue of the Apoſtolical Letters, which he there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them: An Action ſo Surprizing, did ſo Exaſperate the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they had certainly cut this indiſcreet Abbot in a thouſand Pieces, if <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort,</hi> who was of his Party, had not ſtoutly oppoſed it, declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his Protector, and proteſting that he would obey the Holy See, and never employ thoſe Arms againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which in taking upon him the Croſs, he had taken up to make War againſt the <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Princes, and other <hi>French</hi> Lords, to let the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſee that they did not only condemn this Action, but that they were reſolved, like Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and in deſpite of all thoſe who oppoſed it, to perform, what they had not promiſed, but that notwithſtanding their Vow, they might well, both in point of Conſcience, and for very conſiderable Reaſons do, gave ſuch a furious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault to the City, both by Sea and Land, without Intermiſſion, for five days ſucceſſively, that the Beſieged were compelled to Surrender upon Diſcretion, their Lives only ſaved. After this, the Seaſon of the Year being too far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, to think of making War in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was reſolved to paſs the Winter at <hi>Zara,</hi> where the Marquis <hi>Boniface</hi> came, about fifteen days after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Place; for he would not imbark with the reſt, upon pretence of giving ſome neceſſary Orders, concerning the preſſing Affairs of his Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate; but in reallity, that he might dexterouſly avoid appearing at the Siege of <hi>Zara,</hi> and prevent the Diſpleaſure of the Pope; tho not long after the Pope received the Excuſes which the <hi>French</hi> made him by their Deputies, and granted them the Pardon which they demanded, for the greater Satisfaction of their Conſciences. He alſo permitted them, for the removing of all Scruples, the Liberty of Treating at all times with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who could not be perſuaded to believe themſelves obliged, to deſire from him the Abſolution from thoſe Cenſures, which they thought they had not at all deſerved; for which Reaſon, ſome time after, he denounced them Excommunicated by a Decree, which the Princes thought convenient to ſuppreſs, fearing that otherwiſe it might give occaſion intirely to ruine the Enterpriſe of the Holy War, as undoubtedly it would have done.</p>
                  <p>It was for this Reaſon that this ſage Pope, to whom the <hi>French</hi> Princes gave an account of their Proceedings, by Letters reſpectful, but very reſolute, after having throughly weighed the Matter, approved the Prudence of their Conduct; and ſome time after, their Spirits being ſweetned by a more propitious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, a Reconciliation eaſily enſued, to the ſatisfaction of all Parties. Thus it is, when Matters are managed with Charity, Sweetneſs, and Deſcretion, and that Authority acts prudently and ſeaſonably, it ever preſerves its own Rights, by preſerving theirs whom it reduces by gentle Methods to their Obedience, but when untuly Paſſion comes to intermedle, and to pour out its Lightnings and Thunder, with more Precipitation than Reaſon, it loſeth it ſelf, making thoſe become Rebels, who would eaſily have been brought back again to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and is at laſt obliged to have Recourſe to Rigor, to make them ſubmit to the Yoke, which with good Uſage they might have, with far leſs Difficulty,

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> and which upon any Advantage they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to indeavour to ſhake off. In the mean time, the <hi>Cruſades</hi> had the leiſure of the whole Winter, in a rich City, and the Country about, abounding with all manner of Proviſions, to make the neceſſary Preparations againſt the Spring, for the Conqueſt of <hi>Egypt;</hi> when the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abia,</hi> and his Brother-in-Law <hi>Alexis,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made them ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly alter their Deſign, and undertake an Enterpriſe, which was moſt glorious to the <hi>French,</hi> to whom God had deſigned the Empire of the Eaſt, which was tranſlated from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Latins,</hi> in this admirable Manner, which I am about to relate, wherein I ſhall briefly recount the Cauſe, the Progreſs, the Conſequence, the Execution and Accompliſhment of one of the moſt ſurprizing and memorable Adventures that ever was known in the World.</p>
                  <p>It was about ſeven Years before, that the Emperor <hi>Iſaac Angelus,</hi> by the moſt juſt Judgment of God, who was determined to puniſh ſo many horrible Crimes as he had committed during the nine Years of his Reign, was tumbled from his Throne by his own Brother <hi>Alexis,</hi> who took upon him the Sirname of <hi>Comnenius,</hi> and who after having barbarouſly put out his Eyes, cauſed him alſo inhumanly to be put in Irons, with his Son <hi>Alexis,</hi> a young Prince, of about twelve Years of Age. Now it being only his Ambition, which had rendred this Tyrant ſo Cruel, who otherways was of a Nature Humane and Sweet enough, ſo ſoon as he believed he was firmly Eſtabliſhed in his unjuſt Domination, and that he had no reaſon to fear that any thing Dangerous could be enterprized againſt him, he forgot that Maxim of Tyrants, which informs them, <hi>That he who will peaceably and ſecurely enjoy his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, muſt not do his Work by halves.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he began to compaſſionate thoſe whom he had deſpoiled of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Dignity, and after ſome Years of ſevere Impriſonment, to reſtore them to a great ſhare of unexpected Liberty. He gave Permiſſion to his Brother to live handſomely in a Palace, which he aſſigned him out of the City, between the two Colomnes; and ſuffered the young <hi>Alexis</hi> to hold the Rank of one of the Princes of his Court, commanding him to attend upon his Perſon, and be his Companion in all his Divertiſements. But he learnt preſently after, that the Policy of an Uſurper ought to take better Precautions, than to beſtow that kind of Bounty upon thoſe whom he hath injuſtly Oppreſſed, which may furniſh them with an Opportunity of doing themſelves Reaſon for the Violence which they have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Iſaac</hi> having the Liberty to receive all ſuch as came to viſit him, treated ſo ſecretly with the <hi>Latins,</hi> that by their means he found a ſafe way of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with his Daughter <hi>Irene,</hi> the Wife of the Emperor <hi>Philip.</hi> And ſo ſoon as that Princeſs had diſpoſed the Spirit of her Husband, to take theſe poor Princes into his Protection, and to receive the young <hi>Alexis</hi> her Brother, a Merchant of <hi>Piſa</hi> undertook to carry him off in his Ship; To effect this, he cauſed him to be diſguiſed like an <hi>Italian</hi> Seaman, and when the Guards, which the Tyrant ſent to ſearch in all the Ships, ſo ſoon as he underſtood his Flight, came aboard the <hi>Piſan,</hi> who lying at the Mouth of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> ready to Sail, was ſearched with more Exactneſs than any of the reſt: The diſguiſhed Prince, with thoſe of his Retinue, who were all on the ſuddain become Mariners, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received them upon the Deck, and undertook himſelf to be their Conductor, leading them into the moſt ſecret Places of the Veſſel, and thus, by not being hid, eſcaped moſt ſecurely the Danger of being Found; ſo that the Ship being thereupon diſcharged, paſſed the <hi>Strait,</hi> and the Prince was ſafely landed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to implore the Aſſiſtance of Pope <hi>Innocent;</hi> from thence he paſſed by Land to the Court of his Brother-in-Law into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and in his Way coming to <hi>Verona,</hi> he met with abundance of Pilgrims, who were going to joyn the Army of the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> at <hi>Venice;</hi> there ſome of his Retinue adviſed him to ſend Deputies to them, to lend him their Aſſiſtance for the Recovery of his Empire. They arrived at the Army whileſt they were making their Preparations in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> for their Voyage into <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the Princes judged that before they came to any Concluſion in an Affair of that Importance, it was neceſſary to ſend to the Emperor <hi>Philip</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> to be informed from him, what Terms the Prince of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would offer,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64918:133"/>and what was to be expected from him,
<label type="milestone">

                  <p>This Diſcourſe, which ſeemed ſo reaſonable and perſuaſive, was very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly received by that Aſſembly, who reſolved to take ſome time to deliberate upon ſuch ſair Propoſitions. In truth, the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the greateſt Party of the <hi>French,</hi> who, beſides the Intereſt of the publick, and the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity, found alſo therein their own, made not the leaſt doubt, but that the Propoſitions ought to be accepted; but thoſe who had before uſed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Efforts, to hinder the Seige of <hi>Zara,</hi> oppoſed them with abundance of Heat; and, above all the reſt, the Abbot <hi>du Val de Sernay,</hi> who was conſtantly in the Head of the diſcontented Party, made a mighty Noiſe with his Monks, proteſting againſt this Diverſion, and urging that they could not, with a ſafe Conſcience, turn thoſe Arms againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they had taken up for a Holy War againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> for the Deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre.

Whereupon, before any thing was concluded, the Cardinal of <hi>Capua,</hi> one of the Legates, at the Requeſt of the Princes and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, went immediately to conſult the Pope; who put the Matter under the Deliberation of the Sacred College at the ſame time, when, by an odd Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Ambaſſadors of the Uſurper <hi>Alexis Comnenius,</hi> who came to juſtifie

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1202</label> The Pope preſently gave them Audience; and they, according to their Inſtructions, and the Emperor's Letters, remonſtrated to him, That <hi>Iſaac</hi> having been lawfully depoſed for his apparent Inſufficiency, the Empire could not, by Right of Succeſſion, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the young <hi>Alexis,</hi> by reaſon that he was born before his Father was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and that therefore, of conſequence, it muſt neceſſarily belong to his Unkle <hi>Alexis Comnenius,</hi> who was legally choſen Emperor. That he therefore made it his Requeſt to the Pope, that he would not favour his Nephew, who was ſupported in his unjuſt Pretences by <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Suabia,</hi> the declared Enemy of the Holy See, as his Father and Grandfather had been, who had raiſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wars againſt the Popes, his Predeceſſors. And further, they deſired that he would prohibit the <hi>Cruſades</hi> from going to attack <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> contrary to the Vow which they had made to endeavour the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> And then following the Cuſtom of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, who, when they have any need of the Aſſiſtance of the Popes, always promiſe the Re-union of the Church, they made a thouſand Proteſtations of the ſincere Intentions of their Maſter; and that he would cauſe that Obedience to be rendred to the Pope, throughout the whole Eaſtern Empire, which was due unto him.</p>
                  <p>But whether the Pope hoped for that Re-union from <hi>Comnenius,</hi> who was in Poſſeſſion of the Empire, rather than from the young <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was a baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſpoiled Prince; and that he apprehended that the Succeſs of this War would not prove fortunate; or that he could not, upon this Occaſion, perſuade himſelf to favour the Pretenſions of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Suabia,</hi> whom he did not love, and whoſe Competitor to the Empire he openly protected; or whether it was the earneſt deſire which he had, that the Expedition to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> ſhould be more vigorouſly proſecuted, which made him diſapprove theſe kind of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which were made of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arms againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it is certain that he received the Ambaſſadors of old <hi>Alexis</hi> very favourably, acknowledging their Maſter as an Emperor. And further, He was ſo far from protecting the Prince, as many of the Cardinals adviſed, that he ſent back the Legate to the Army of the Confederates, with Letters, by which he command them, in moſt perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Terms, to march immediately to the War againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and to give over the Enterpriſe of <hi>Conſtaminople,</hi> as apparently contrary to their firſt Deſign. But in this time, the <hi>French</hi> Princes, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were of another Opinion, and believed this to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt Way to obtain that End; as alſo, conſidering that the Pope had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Letters to oppoſe that Reaſon, they believed that he had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed of their Intentions of making <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the Way to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And therefore, notwithſtanding his Letters, they proceeded in the Treaty, and at length finiſhed it, by accepting of the Conditions offered by the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Philip</hi> and the young <hi>Alexis;</hi> they reciprocally engaging to eſtabliſh him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and in order thereto, fifteen Days after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to march with the Army and Navy, to his Aſſiſtance. The Articles of which Treaty were on each ſide ratified by mutual Oaths, and ſigned by the Doge, Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Flanders, Blois</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and eight of the principal Lords of their Party, which, without Compariſon, was much the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Diviſion, however, ſtill continued, and was ſo far from being quieted by theſe Letters of the Pope, that, on the contrary, it was more angmented by them; and there being ſuch a fair Colour for a Separation, after this plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of a Soveraign Pope, many thereupon took occaſion to abandon the Army; ſome to return into their Native Country, which notwithſtanding, they never did, but miſerably periſhed, either by Shipwracks upon the Sea, or by Thieves and the Peaſants at Land, who fell upon them in their Paſſage, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them of all they had, even to their very Lives: Others left the Army, to go directly into <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> as did <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Guy,</hi> Earls of <hi>Montfort,</hi> with their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>du Val de Sernay;</hi> who were followed by the three Brothers, <hi>Enguerrand, Robert</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Boves,</hi> and all thoſe whom they could draw along with them, either by their Example, their Perſuaſions, or the Authority they had upon their Dependants. The Abbot <hi>de la Trappe,</hi> who, from the Beginning, fell in with that Party, did not fail to follow it to the End, and accompanied them to

Thus the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army remained much weakned by the Retreat of ſo many brave Men, who, had they been firmly united to their Head, might have done conſiderable Services, and avoided thoſe Misfortunes which, by their Separation, fell upon them. As for the Pope, he took it ſo heinouſly that the Confederates had not obeyed his Orders and Advice, that he commanded his two Legates, the Cardinals of <hi>Capua</hi> and St. <hi>Praxede,</hi> to withdraw from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſent them expreſs Order to ſail to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and after into <hi>Syria,</hi> there, on his Behalf, to negotiate with the <hi>Cruſades</hi> who were gone from <hi>Hungary,</hi> and had imbarked in the Ports of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princes, notwithſtanding this Defection, purſued their Enterpriſe with more Courage and Reſolution; and they had the Comfort preſently after to underſtand that the Pope, as they had hoped, being better informed, had at laſt conſented to their Deſign: So that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> after they had demoliſhed <hi>Zara,</hi> to prevent its Revolt for the future, cauſed the whole Army, conſiſting in about forty thouſand Combatants, to imbark immediately after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Flanders, Blois</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed firſt, ſteering for the Iſle of <hi>Corfu,</hi> at that time belonging to the Eaſtern Empire, where the whole Navy was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to rendezvous. The Doge and the Marquis <hi>de Montferrat</hi> ſtayed ſome time longer at the Port of <hi>Zara,</hi> to attend the Prince <hi>Alexis,</hi> who in a few days, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as had been agreed, arrived there, very handſomly attended. There he was received by the Doge with all manner of Magnificence; there were Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and other Veſſels preſented him, for himſelf, and thoſe of his Retinue: And the Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> who had the Honour to be his Ally, and to whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had extreamly recommended the Care of him, after he had done him all the Honours imaginable, proteſted to him, that he would ſacrifice all for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that he would never abandon him, till he ſaw him ſeated upon that Throne which the Uſurper ſo injuriouſly detained from him. After this, the Fleet weighed; and, for a happy Beginning of this War, as they came before <hi>Duras,</hi> anciently <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> a moſt important City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and one of the Keys of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, the Inhabitants having learnt that the Prince <hi>Alexis</hi> was on Board that Fleet, they carried him the Keys of the Place, and ſwore an inviolable Fidelity to him.

By theſe Arts they debauched a great Party of the Soldiers, of whom they had Aſſurance upon Occaſion, though for the preſent they durſt not declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Princes, who perceived it, were dreadfully afraid of the Danger which they apprehended might enſue upon their being Abandoned by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Soldiers, and thereby ſeeing themſelves reduced to a Diſability of purſuing the Enterpriſe which they had ſo happily begun. Whereupon after mature Deliberation, and a clear Underſtanding of the Matter, they concluded, that if upon this Occaſion they ſhould go about to make uſe of their Authority, and think by Compulſion to procure Obedience, therebeing ſo many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords and Gentlemen, who were not uſed to be ſo treated, it might make them run the Hazard of deſtroying one another, and prove a Remedy incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably worſe than the Diſeaſe; they reſolved therefore upon an odd Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which as it was without all Preſident, ſo in probability, it will never be an Example for future Imitation. For immediately mounting on Horſeback, with the Prince of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the Biſhops and Abbots, which were of their Party, they went to find out the principal of the Cabal, who were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeparated from the Army, the chief of which were <hi>Eudes de Champlite, James d' Aveſnes, Peter de Amiens, Guy de Coucy, William d' Aunoy, Guy de Chappes, Guy de Conſtans, Richard,</hi> and <hi>Eudes de Dampierre.</hi> The Princes no ſooner ſaw them but they alighted from their Horſes, which obliged the Malecontents to do the ſame, being much ſurprized to ſee thoſe great Princes come with ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gentlemen, who aſſuredly were much their Inferiors both in Birth and Quality; but they were much more amazed, when the Princes being come up to them, threw themſelves at their Feet, and with Eyes bathed in Tears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them in the Name of God, not to abandon them in an Enterpriſe, upon which the Recovery of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> abſolutely depended; and proteſted that they would never riſe from that Poſture, till they had obtained the Favour they deſired.</p>
                  <p>In truth, this ſurprizing way, ſo wholly Irregular, and ſo much below the Dignity of Princes, had nothing of Policy in it, being apt to expoſe Majeſty to Contempt, and render Authority diſpiſable to Subjects and Soldiers, who by ſuch Submiſſions are uſually made more Fierce, becauſe they ſeem to make them more Conſiderable: But there are certain Moments and Encounters, wherein a kind of irregular Conduct, wholly extraordinary, and againſt all manner of Forms, ſhall immediately gain that by Surpriſe, which all humane Prudence, managed by Methods, and according to Rules of Art, ſhall never be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the ſtrongeſt Force of Reaſon and Argument. Theſe Gentlemen, afraid and aſhamed to ſee thoſe Perſons at their Feet, whom Nature had elevated above them, and their own Choice had made their Heads, were ſo touched with this Action, that unable to retain their Sobs and Tears, they proſtrated themſelves before the Princes, and promiſed them intire Satisfaction of their Demands. And after having conſulted a few Minutes among themſelves, that ſo they might act more firmly by common Conſent, they ingaged to ſerve them with all their Troops, in the War of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> till the end of <hi>September,</hi> provided the Princes would promiſe upon Oath, upon the expiration of that Term, in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days to furniſh them with ſuch Shipping as was requiſite for their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conditions being accepted, and mutual Faith on both Sides given, with all the Marks of a perfect Reconciliation, they Imbarked on the Eve of <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday,</hi> and after having coaſted all <hi>Morea</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> the Fleet came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the <hi>Negropont,</hi> where being divided into two Squadrons, the firſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Prince <hi>Alexis,</hi> with the Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> and Count <hi>Baldwin,</hi> ſailed to the Iſle of <hi>Andros,</hi> where the Inhabitants immediately yielded themſelves to their Prince: The ſecond ſailed to rights to the Straits of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> where
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64918:136"/>they made a Deſcent at the City of <hi>Abydus,</hi>

So that all the Fleet had the Opportunity to aſſemble, as it did in eight Days after; and then paſſed the Chanal which ſeemed all covered between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> with Ships and Gallies, which compoſed the gallanteſt Fleet that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had ever ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Seas; they came to an Anchor at the Port of the Abby of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> upon the Bank of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> on the <hi>Thracian</hi> Coaſt; about five or ſix miles from <hi>Heptapyrgium,</hi> which is the famous Caſtle of ſeven Towers. From thence, as they reſolved to go to the Iſlands of thoſe Seas, to ſecure themſelves of Proviſions before they attempted to form a Siege by Land againſt ſo great and ſtrong a City, the Wind and the Current carried the Fleet from the Weſt to the Eaſt along by the Coaſt of the City which is ſituate upon the <hi>Propontis</hi> ſo near the Walls, which were all crouded with <hi>Greek</hi> Soldiers, that with their Darts they might reach the Ships. The Ships alſo came ſo near as to be able to ſtrike a Terror into the Hearts of the moſt undaunted, who might at one View diſcover three hundred Veſſels, in order of Battle, which made the faireſt and yet one of the moſt terrible Sights in the World; the Standards flying upon the Poops, the Enſigns diſplaid, the Flags, and Pendants flying in the Wind, the <hi>Machines</hi> mounted upon the Decks, and the Shields of the Knights painted with their Arms, glittering with Gold and Silver, ranged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Hatches, ſeemed to repreſent the Battlements of ſome glorious City. It was in this Condition that this Gallant and formidable Navy bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with full Sails before the Wind, was carried to the Port of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> where the Army made an immediate Deſcent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſometimes ſo famous for the fourth Univerſal Council, which was there held under the Emperor <hi>Martian</hi> in the Papacy of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> in the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Church of St. <hi>Euphemia,</hi> was at this time an indifferent fair City, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> which advancing it ſelf into the Sea at the Entrance of the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> over againſt <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> forms upon its two ſides two Ports, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that which is upon the Eaſt, was very large and capable of receiving a great number of ſhips; that which rendred it more conſiderable was the proud Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, which the Emperors had cauſed to be built, near that City, there to enjoy the Beauty of the Place, and the Sweetneſs of the Country Air which hath the Reputation of being very healthful. But ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> are become Maſters of the Empire, they have in ſuch manner ruined this poor City and all the Country thereabout. That there remain ſcarcely any Footſteps either of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces or ſo much as of any Walls; nor is it any thing but a wretched Village, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the Cabins of a few pitiful Fiſhermen. The Port for want of uſe and care being alſo now ſo grown up with Sand, that it admits of no other Veſſels but thoſe poor Fiſher Boots.</p>
                  <p>There it was that upon St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Day, the whole Army land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lodged themſelves moſt commodiouſly, partly in the City, partly in the Palace, and the remainder in the Country Houſes, of Pleaſure thereabouts where they found abundance of Wealth which they put into the Ships, which had now only the Mariners aboard them. Two days after this fair Fleet was conducted to the Port of <hi>Scutari</hi> formerly known by the name of <hi>Chryſopolis,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the Promontory of <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> or that of <hi>Acropolis,</hi> now the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is ſeperated by the Strait not above a good mile.

                  <p>THE Imperial City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Survey and exact Deſcription, in the Second Book of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Iconclaſtes,</hi> conformable to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein it was under the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinus Copro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus,</hi> was neither ſo ſtrong, ſo fair, nor ſo well peopled at that time, as it was now when the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make themſelves Maſters of it by plain Force; as for the Multitude of Inhabitants, the Turks having now overrun and conquered the greateſt part of <hi>Natolia,</hi> except ſome Maritime places upon the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> the <hi>Propomis</hi> and the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, the <hi>Aſiatick Greeks</hi> came generally to inhabit at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſecure themſelves from the Tyranny of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> And for its Beauty, it was ſo far from having loſt any, that it was mightily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the great number of Palaces, publick Buildings and magnificent Churches, which ſince that time had been built, which were ſo increaſed that one might count above five hundred of them, which rearing their lofty Spires, and ſtately Towers, above the reſt of the City, ſhewed at once a moſt pleaſing and Majeſtick Proſpect to the Beholders; ſo that when the <hi>Cruſades</hi> firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this great and Illuſtrious City from the higheſt places of the Port of the Abby of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> they were ſo pleaſingly ſurprized, that they were forced to avow, that they had never ſeen any thing comparable to it in the whole World.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly for its Strength, it had all that Nature could contribute to it by its incomparable Situation between three Seas, which invironed it in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Peninſula</hi> of a Triangular Figure, the <hi>Propontis</hi> on the South, the <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> on the Eaſt, and the Gulph which makes the Port, upon the North. Nor was there any thing wanting, which Art could add either towards the Sea or Land, to render it impregnable; and though the Avarice and Negligence of ſome of the later Emperors, had ſuffered it to be much weakned in the Fortifications, yet was it in ſuch a Condition, that the greateſt Captains among the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they had never ſeen any thing more difficult to be undertaken than to beſiege it. For to the Landward it was encompaſſed with double Walls of hewn Stone mingled with Brick, with a Ditch of five and twenty paces breadth, which was filled with a Spring which never ſuffered it to be dry; the two Walls were eighteen Foot diſtance from each other, and extending from the Angle of the <hi>Propontis</hi> on the South, to the ſeven Towers, and from thence to the Gulph upon the North, joyning the Palace and the Gate of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querneſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:64918:137"/>The inward Wall was one hundred Foot high,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> and about twenty broad, having at juſt diſtances eighty ſix Towers to defend it. The outward Wall was not above half ſo high, but in like manner fortified with the ſame Number of ſtrong Towers; and reached from the one Sea to the other upon the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſide, being near two Leagues in length. The Walls which were next the Sea were much lower, but very thick, being above a good mile in length upon that ſide, which is waſhed by the <hi>Propontis</hi> to the point of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one hundred eighty and eight Towers; that ſide of the Gulph, which ſtretches it ſelf towards the North, and makes the Port of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the form of a Creſcent, being above two Leagues, reacheth as far as <hi>Blaquerneſs,</hi> and is defended by one hundred and ten Towers; ſo that admitting there were men enough to guard ſo many Towers, which mutually defend one another, it muſt needs be a very difficult attempt to take the City by Aſſault. Beſides the Port was not only defended by theſe Towers, and Walls, by the <hi>Acropolis</hi> or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs which was upon the Point of the Promontory of the <hi>Boſphorus;</hi> but alſo by the ſtrong Town of <hi>Galatha,</hi> ſituate on the other ſide of the Gulph, but above all by the Tower or Caſtle there, from whence a vaſt Chain, ſupported by great Timbers in the Sea, was drawn to the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> and locked up the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Haven.</p>
                  <p>And for the Multitude of thoſe who were to defend the City, it was innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for there were then at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> above a hundred thouſand men ſit to ſerve on Horſeback, and more than three times that number of Foot well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; beſides the Soldiers of the Imperial Guard, which was very ſtrong and compoſed principally of the <hi>Engliſh-Danes,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Barranges,</hi> which being baniſhed from <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Edward,</hi> who was deſcended from the Ancient <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> Kings, had betaken themſelves to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, who had uſed theſe People for above a hundred and fifty Years, as their Ordinary Guards.</p>
                  <p>This was the Condition wherein <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> then ſtood, to the Strength of which <hi>Alexis Commenius</hi> too much truſted, believing it impoſſible for the Power of the whole Earth, if it were aſſembled together to be able to force it. This Prince had acquired the Reputation of a valiant man and a great Captain before he came to the Empire; and that was one great reaſon that he met with no greater Oppoſition in his Uſurpation; for it was generally believed that he was another kind of man for War and Buſineſs than his Brother <hi>Iſaac Angelus,</hi> and that therefore he would by his Arms, better ſupport the Majeſty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and its Dominions againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who frequently attacked them with great advantage. But it is too often ſeen that the Change of Fortune and a happy State, produce alſo a Change in the manners, and the Conduct of men; and thoſe Vices, which before it was neceſſary to conceal, by the appearance of Vertue, appear barefaced when they come to have Liberty fortified by Power, and are from under the Curb and Diſcipline of Fear. So this <hi>Alexis</hi> was no ſooner an Emperor, but that he became the moſt cowardly and diſſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, never thinking of any thing but how to drown himſelf in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and abandoning the Care of the publick Affairs to thoſe who either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected them, or at leaſt regarded them only to ſearch for opportunities of inriching themſelves out of the Spoils of the publick. And indeed he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly now become moſt ſtupid, for though it was the Town Diſcourſe at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> what great Preparations the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> were making, and that they had undertaken to reſettle the Young <hi>Alexis</hi> in the Throne, yet did he not make the leaſt Preparations for a War; only ſome times in the Jollity of his Entertainments, and the Heat of his Wine, in which he plunged himſelf day after day; when his Head was warm he would tell thoſe who were the Companions of his Debauches, that he would ſend out a Party of his Guards, who ſhould bring this handful of Hairbrain Fellows bound in Irons, who being weary of their Lives were come ſo far to ſearch for Death at ſo great a charge, to have the Honor to die by his Commands. Nor did he recover out of this profound Lethargie, till he underſtood that the Confederate Army, after the Reduction of <hi>Duras,</hi> had aſſured themſelves of the Iſle of <hi>Corfu;</hi> and then indeed he began to give Orders for the Defence of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> cauſing all the Soldiers which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64918:138"/>were quartered round the Country to enter into the City;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> all that he could do to hinder them from entring into the Port, was to arme twenty Gallies, to guard the Chain, ſo disfurniſhed was his <hi>Arſenal</hi> by the Negligence or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of his Brother-in-Law <hi>Michel Stryphnus,</hi> the high Admiral, who had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sails, the Cordage, the Anchors, and even the Bolts and Iron Nails of his Navy into Gold and Silver.</p>
                  <p>Having in this manner provided for the Defence of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo ſoon as he ſaw the Confederate Army was landed at <hi>Scutari,</hi> he drew out and encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped alſo with the greateſt part of his Army upon the Bank of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> oppoſite to the Camp of the Confederates, who took ſome days to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, before they reſolved to paſs the Arm of the Sea, in the ſight of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his Army, which was incomparably more in number than theirs: And in the mean time <hi>Alexis</hi> cauſed his Brother-in-Law with the choice of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry to paſs over three or four Leagues, below the two Camps, to hinder the <hi>Latins</hi> from forraging, and to glean up ſuch as they found ſtraggling for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Fields. This gave an occaſion to ſome brave men to make a happy Preſage of this War, by ſuch an uncommon Action of Galantry, as made it equally apparent, how reſolute and undaunted the <hi>French</hi> were, and what ſhameful Cowards thoſe were upon whom the Emperor depended as the moſt Valiant men of his Army.</p>
                  <p>For about fourſcore Cavaliers under the Conduct of <hi>Eudes</hi> and <hi>William de Champlite,</hi> the Count <hi>Gras,</hi> who came along with the Marquis <hi>Montferrat,</hi> of <hi>Oger de</hi> Saint <hi>Cheron,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes de L' Iſle,</hi> being gone out to ſcore the Fields and Convoy the Forragers, diſcovered at a good diſtance this Brigade of <hi>Greeks,</hi> wherein there was at leaſt five hundred men at Arms, with a Proportionate number of Foot, incamped at the Foot of a Hill which covered them. This great in equality could not hinder theſe Valiant men from a ſudden and generous reſolution to attack them even in their Camp. Having therefore divided themſelves into four little Squadrons, at the ſame time that the <hi>Greeks</hi> diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo finall a number of Horſe, who had no Infantry to ſuſtain them, were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in Battle without their Camp, with an Intention to ſurround them, they marched to charge the Enemy, who made ſhew of receiving them; but upon the firſt ſhock theſe cowardly <hi>Greeks,</hi> unable to indure the Sight of the <hi>Latins,</hi> whom they thought Devils rather than men, ſeeing with what Heat and Fury they ran to the Charge, immediately routed themſelves and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them to a ſhameful Flight, following the example of their Captains who were not in the Rere at that time; ſo that the Squadrons who purſued them for a good League killed a great many without reſiſtance, whileſt the reſt ſaved themſelves upon their ſhips, leaving the Conquerors Maſters of their Camp, where they found a rich Booty, which infinitely rejoyced the whole Army, who now regarded no more the Cowardly Multitude of their Enemies, but as a ſort of People with whoſe ſpoils they were to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ſo pitifully Timerous as a wicked man, who is attacked with a potent Enemy without, at the ſame time that his guilty Conſcience makes a cruel War within his Soul; <hi>Alexis</hi> who was aſtoniſhed at this unlucky begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and who had now more than ever before his Eyes the terrible Image of his Crimes, the dreadful Puniſhment whereof he feared the <hi>Latins</hi> were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, beſieved that it was his beſt way to endeavour to make a Peace and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void an unpropitious War, but withal without ſhewing any Fear, that ſo he might obtain what he did ſo earneſtly hope. For this purpoſe the next day he ſent to the Princes a Gentleman of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> called <hi>Nicholas Roſſi,</hi> who was an Inhabitant of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The <hi>Lombard</hi> after he had ſhewn them his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credence, the Confederates being Aſſembled in the Palace of <hi>Scutari,</hi> to give him Audience, delivered himſelf after this manner. <hi>He acquainted them that the Emperor his Maſter, was very well acquainted with their Merit and their Quality, which did not give place to any in the World, except crowned Heads; That he was well informed that they had taken upon them the Croſs, and armed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>to recover the Holy Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt out of their wicked Hands; that therefore he was much amazed to, find that inſtead of purſuing that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>This was what the Envoy had in charge to ſay, who by the cunning Artifice of the Tyrant, was taught not to touch in the leaſt upon that jarring String of his violent Uſurpation, which he very well knew was the ſole Canſe of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. It was for this reaſon that the Princes, after a Moments Deliberation upon what was fit to be done upon this occaſion, deſired <hi>Conon de Bethune,</hi> a Knight who had the Reputation to be one of the diſcreeteſt men and beſt Speakers of his time to give an Anſwer to the Envoy, which with great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Eloquence he did in theſe Terms. <hi>Tell your Maſter from the Princes and Confederate Lords, that his Aſtoniſhment is neither rational nor ſincere; That he knows better than to need any Information, that it is not upon the Lands of his Empire that we are entred, ſince the Empire does not appertain to him; but to the Prince</hi> Alexis <hi>his</hi> Nephew, <hi>whom you ſee here preſent in this Auguſt Aſſembly, and who is the only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir of the Emperor</hi> Iſaac, <hi>from whom his Brother hath moſt unjuſtly and cruelly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the Empire.

                  <p>After this, that the Confederates might once more try what was to be done by the Ways of ſweetneſs, before they ſhould come to make uſe of Force, they reſolved, to ſail by the City, upon the ſide of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and to ſhew the young <hi>Alexis</hi> to the People who would run to the Walls, and invite them to declare in his Favour againſt the Uſurper, thereby if it were poſſible to avoid thoſe Miſchiefs of a War, which muſt of Neceſſity be ſevere to ſuch as muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be treated like Conquered Rebels, and Complices in the Crimes of the deteſtable Tyrant, But when they perceived that either the Fear of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Uſurper, or the hatred which the <hi>Greeks</hi> had to the <hi>Latins,</hi> hindered the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> from doing any thing in favour of the Prince, a great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War was held the next day on Horſeback in the open Field, where it was reſolved, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould attempt to paſs over the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> below <hi>Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> in ſight of the great Army of <hi>Alexis Comnenius,</hi> which was encamped on the further Bank, and that they ſhould attack <hi>Galatha,</hi> to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Port, at the ſame time that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould ſet upon the Gallies, which deſended the Chain at the Entry of it. For this purpoſe the whole <hi>French</hi> Army was divided into ſix <hi>Bridages;</hi> the firſt was that of the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who had the Van, in regard that he had under his Command, more Archers and Croſs-Bow men than any of the reſt, who were moſt proper to diſperſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother accompanied with <hi>Matthew de Valincourt</hi> had the Second.

And the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64918:139"/>Marquis <hi>Boniface</hi> brought up the Rear,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> with a fair and numerous Troop of his own Subjects, and the <hi>French</hi> who inhabit betwixt the <hi>Alpes</hi> and the <hi>Rhone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was there ſeen to appear greater Courage and Reſolution, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this Enterpriſe, which ſeemed to be the moſt raſh Undertaking in the World, among all the Captains and the Soldiers: For, to ſhew that they were all determined either to die or to force their Paſſage, in deſpight of the Army of the Enemies, though ten times ſtronger than theirs, they made their Wills, and received Abſolution from the Biſhops and Abbots; who, to encourage them to do bravely, put themſelves alſo aboard the Ships with the Princes and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. There were about two hundred who were ranged in two great Lines: The Knights and the Men at Arms went foremoſt upon the flat bottom'd Boats, their Servants holding their Horſes, ſadled and capariſon'd with rich Houſſes of Taffata down to their Feet, and, according to the manner of that Age, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Arms of their Maſters: Upon each ſide of them rowed the Long-Boats, filled with Archers and Croſs-Bows, who, as they advanced to the other ſide, diſcharged a mortal Shower of Steel, without ceaſing, upon their Enemies. The ſecond Line was compoſed of Gallies, every one of which towed a great Ship, that ſo they might come up all together, and make the ſtronger Charge upon the Enemy, by fighting all at once on the ſeveral parts of the Bank upon which they were poſted.</p>
                  <p>The whole Army being in this manner imbarked, every one keeping the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein the ſix Squadrons were diſpoſed upon the two Lines, early in the Morning, the 8th Day of <hi>July,</hi> they began to row to rights againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; who, on their ſide, advanced in good Order towards the Shoar. Never could there be ſeen any thing more terribly beautiful than this Spectacle: The Sky was mighty ſerene, and the Sun, which now juſt began to raiſe his glorious Head above the Hemiſphere, darting his bright Beams upon the Helmets, the Bucklers, and the naked Swords, which were advanced in the Air, made ſuch a dreadful Glittering, as being augmented by the Reflection of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> whoſe Waters being as ſmooth as poliſhed Glaſs by reaſon of the great Calm which then happened, dazled the Eyes of the Beholders, and appeared as if all the Air had been on fire. That glorious Luminary, in this Rencounter, was doubly favourable to the <hi>French,</hi> by reaſon that the Fleet rowing from Eaſt to Weſt, they had it on their Backs at the ſame time that he ſhot his kind Beams directly into the Eyes of their Enemies: beſides that, a ſmall Eaſterly Wind riſing with the Sun, drove them gently toward the other Shoar, which was at no great diſtance, the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> in that place, being not above half a League over: So that one might eaſily diſtinguiſh the Squadrons and Battalions of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in very good Order, and in prodigious numbers, drawn up all along the oppoſite Shoar, and the Emperor at the Head of them, endeavouring to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them by his Voice and Geſture, to repulſe that handful of Pirates, as he called them in Contempt, who had no other Force but what they borrowed from a Brutal Raſhneſs, and the little Eſteem they had for their wretched Lives, which they might, without trouble, be quickly eaſed of, by throwing them headlong from the ſteep Banks which they endeavoured to gain, and cooling their fooliſh and audacious Courage in the Waters of the <hi>Boſphorus.</hi> The Shoar echoed, and the Sea ſeemed to tremble at the dreadful Sound of a thouſand Trumpets and Cornets, and the Shouts of the Soldiers, which were terribly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, thereby to encourage one another, and to ſtrike a Terrour into their Enemies: The very Oars were not wanting to make up the dreadful Harmony, claſhing againſt the Water with an extraordinary force, to gain the Shoar; which they quickly did, with an incredible Heat, both of the Mariners and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and above all, the Captains, and the Gentlemen of Quality.</p>
                  <p>For ſo ſoon as they came near the Land, the Knights, in their Compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, covered with their Shields, leap'd up to the Middle into the Sea, with their Swords in their Hands; and in deſpight of the dreadful Shower of Darts and Arrows. which the <hi>Greeks</hi> from all Parts poured upon them, they ran to charge the firſt Battalions, whilſt the Soldiers, animated by their brave Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, threw themſelves out of the Ships, ſome into the Sea, ſome upon the Shoar, every one having a deſire of the Honour of being foremoſt to come to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64918:139"/>but the Cowardice of <hi>Commenius</hi> and his <hi>Greeks</hi> did not permit them that Favour;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> for though at firſt they put on the Countenance of Soldiers and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Men, whilſt there was no other fighting but with the Croſs-bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, yet ſo ſoon as they ſaw the <hi>French,</hi> without ſtaying for the diſ-imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Horſes, march directly towards them, with their Swords in their Hands; this infinite Rabble turned Head, and ſled with ſo much ſpeed, that the Count <hi>de St. Paul,</hi> who was one of the firſt that charged them, pleaſantly writ in his Letter to the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> that they out-ran the very Arrows which were ſhot after them; ſo ſwift were their Feet, by the ſuddain Terrour which then ſiezed them; and put all thoſe Spirits, which ſhould have actuated their Hands and Hearts, into their Heels. So that the Army was conſtrained to give them over to their own Fear, which purſued them, nothing elſe being able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, whilſt the Princes had leiſure to throw out the Bridges, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark the Horſes, and range the Army, as was before agreed, into ſix Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.</p>
                  <p>Now they imagining that <hi>Alexis Comnenius,</hi> after his Flight, was retreated to his Camp, they reſolved immediately to attack him there; but he eaſed them of that trouble, for they preſently found that this Cowardly Prince had, for his ſafety, abandoned it with ſo much Precipitation, that he had left behind him his Tents and Equipage, and all the Baggage of his Army; with which the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers inriched themſelves. After this, the Night approaching, they lodged themſelves commodiouſly in the Quarter of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was upon the Bank of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> near the Caſtle of <hi>Galatha,</hi> which they reſolved the next Day to attack, thereby to gain the Command of the Haven; but they were prevented by the Garriſon of the <hi>Engliſh-Danes, Piſans,</hi> and other Strangers, to whom the Emperors had intruſted the Keeping of that Place; who, by the Order of <hi>Comne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> made a vigorous Sally the next Morning, being re-inforced by an infinite Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Greek</hi> Soldiers and Burghers, who continually paſſed from <hi>Pera</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. Inſomuch, that theſe Strangers, who were good Men, and found few of the <hi>French</hi> prepared to receive them, had, at firſt, ſome Advantage. The valiant <hi>James d' Aveſnes,</hi> who was the firſt that advanced with what Infantry he could get together to oppoſe them, received a great Wound in his Face with a Lance, and had undoubtedly been ſlain, if he had not been inſtantly ſuccoured by <hi>Nicholas de Laulain,</hi> one of his Knights, who drew him out of the Preſs of his Enemies, with which he was ſurrounded; and by a prodigious Valour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſingly ſuſtained the Brunt, till the reſt of the Troops came up, who haſted from all Parts, to the Combat. Then it was that they furiouſly charged theſe Soldiers of the Garriſon of <hi>Galatha,</hi> who ſighting bravely, were moſt of them cut in pieces; the reſt, crowded by that confuſed Multitude of <hi>Greeks,</hi> who preſently took the Fright, ſled with ſo great haſte and Diſorder, that one part of them running towards the Port, to recover their Barks, threw themſelves into them with ſuch Precipitation, that they ſunk the Veſſels, and were drowned, whilſt others thinking to ſave themſelves in the Caſtle of <hi>Galatha,</hi> did in ſuch a manner, by their Multitude, ſtop up the Paſſage of the Gate, every one being deſirous to be the foremoſt, that thoſe who purſued them cloſely would not give them the liberty to ſhut it: ſo that, after a bloody Combat, which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by theſe miſerable Men out of perfect Neceſſity and Deſpair, and not by true Courage and Valour, the <hi>French</hi> gained the Gate; and after they had either taken or ſlain all ſuch as made any Reſiſtance, they remained Maſters of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and of the Chain.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time alſo wherein the <hi>French</hi> performed this memorable Action, the <hi>Venetians</hi> having drawn up their Fleet in Order, in the Chanal below <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari,</hi> turned the Prows of their Gallies and Ships againſt the Entry of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and under the favour of a Tide-Wind, which blew from the Eaſt, juſt in their Sterns, they bore up to the Chain, from their Engines, which threw Darts and great Stones, battering and bruiſing the five and twenty Gallies, and other Ships, which lay there to defend it: Inſomuch, that one of the greateſt Ships coming up cloſe to the Chain, whilſt the others continually diſcharged againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they cut the Chain in two with prodigious Sciſſors of Steel, which were opened and ſhut with an Engine. After which, having broken and chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64918:140"/>in pieces the Timbers that ſupported the Chain, the whole <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet freely entred the Port, and all the <hi>Greek</hi> Veſſels were either taken, diſabled or ſunk.</p>
                  <p>This was but the beginning of the moſt wonderful and hazardous Enterpriſe that ever was undertaken; which was, to take a City, in which, for one that attacked it, the Mareſhal <hi>de Ville Hardouin</hi> tells us, there were two hundred to defend it. However, in order thereunto, it was reſolved that there ſhould be two Attacks; the one by Sea, on the Port ſide; and the other by Land, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs,</hi> near that end of the Wall which adjoyns to the Haven. The <hi>Venetians</hi> undertook the firſt, and the <hi>French</hi> made Choice of the ſecond, becauſe that, in thoſe times, they were not acquainted with fighting on Ship-board, as were the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were then accounted the moſt potent and able Sea-men of the World, having, as it were, founded their Empire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Watry Element. Having therefore, for four days, made all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations neceſſary for their Attacks, the <hi>French</hi> Army coaſting along by the Fleet, marched near two Leagues to the Stone-Bridge, which is a little below the place where the River <hi>Barbyſes,</hi> joyning its Streams with that of <hi>Cydaris,</hi> diſchargeth it ſelf into the Bottom of the Haven. This Bridge was ſomething longer than that which is called the Small Bridge, at <hi>Paris;</hi> and ſo narrow, that not above three Horſe-men could paſs abreaſt upon it: So that, if the <hi>Greeks</hi> had had any Courage, they might eaſily have maintained it; but they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with breaking it, and that being eaſily repaired in the Night, the whole Army paſſed over it without Moleſtation; and having put themſelves into the ſame Order as before, of ſix Bodies, they encamped in the Valley of <hi>Blaquerneſs,</hi> between the City and the <hi>Coſmidium</hi> or Monaſtery of St. <hi>Coſmus,</hi> which was ſometimes called <hi>Bohemond</hi>'s Caſtle, becauſe that Prince lodged there when he was at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Cruſade.</hi> The Camp was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified, and the Engines prepared to batter the Courtain, and the Towers, which were on the Right and Left, near the Palace, and the Gate of <hi>Blaquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which was the only Quarter which could be beſieged by ſuch a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men; whereas the multitude of the Enemies was innumerable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made continual Sallies, eſpecially under the Conduct of <hi>Theodore Laſcaris,</hi> the Emperor's Son-in-Law, the moſt valiant Man of his Nation: So that the <hi>French</hi> were obliged, almoſt Night and Day, to ſtand to their Arms, to repulſe them; which did ſo tire out the Army, and beſides, they had no great quantity of Proviſions, that there was a neceſſity for them to do what could be done quickly; otherwiſe, in a little time, they would be obliged to raiſe the Seige.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon, after having, for ten Days, continually battered the Walls, it was with that Effect as gave them hopes they might carry the Place by Force. It was therefore reſolved to give a general Aſſault, both by Sea and Land; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, upon the 17th Day of <hi>July,</hi> by Break of Day, the whole Army fell on with all the Courage and Reſolution imaginable. The <hi>Venetians</hi> had drawn all their great Ships along the Brink, in a great Line, about three Flight Shots in length, with Intervals between them, for the Gallies which lay behind them, when it was time to row cloſe to the Shoar, to make the Deſcent. All the great Engines were placed upon the Decks, and the Round Tops of the Maſts were filled with Archers and Croſs-Bows, who might ſhoot downwards, from that Heighth, with great advantage: There were alſo, by the Main Maſts, great Towers raiſed with ſtrong Timber, which ſurpaſſed the heighth of thoſe of the City, upon the Tops of which five or ſix Soldiers might go in a Front, by great and large Steps, which were made from the Top to the Bottom: They were covered with raw Hides, to preſerve them from Fire; and they had long, large and ſtrong Ladders, which were ſo faſtned to the Timbers, that by the help of certain Pullies, and other little Engines, which were made for the purpoſe, they might have the furtheſt end fall upon the Walls, like a Draw-bridge, or be brought to reſt upon the Towers in thoſe places where they jutted out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea. So ſoon as the Signal was given, all the Engines, from the Ships, began to play in an inſtant, and one might ſee an infinite of Stones, Darts and Arrows fly, to ſcatter thoſe who defended the Walls; and at the ſame time the Bridges were thrown upon the Walls, and the Ladders clapp'd to the Towers,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64918:140"/>the Soldiers, three abreaſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> mounting the Ladders with a marvellous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fought hand to hand againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who being aſſiſted both by their number, and the advantage of the place, defended themſelves ſucceſsfully, by rowling great Stones and peices of Timber upon the Aſſailants, throwing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wild ſire among them, and diſcharging from all the Towers a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Shower of Arrows, to hinder the Gallies, who did what they could, from landing.</p>
                  <p>Here the famous <hi>Henry Dandolo</hi> did an Action which exacts the Juſtice of all Poſterity to his Memory, in celebrating his Name, as one of the greateſt Men in the World: For, quite worn with old Age, and blind as he was, yet was he to be ſeen in compleat Armour, with his naked Sword in his hand, upon the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle of the <hi>Capitana,</hi> or Admiral-Gally, having the great Standard of St. <hi>Mark</hi> born before him. The old Prince, tranſported with a valiant Impatience, and and an extream Heat, with which he burnt, to have a ſhare in the Combat, brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded the Sea-men to uſe their utmoſt Skill and Force to get aſhoar, upon peril of their Lives, telling them, if they did not land him preſently, he would hang them up every Man. This Command, given with ſuch a terrible Menace, and which Fear made ſtill more ſtrong, was followed with ſuch a quick Obedience, that the Gally was in an inſtant brought to the Shoar, through a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Storm of Stones, Darts and Arrows, which from all parts fell upon her. Then was to be ſeen the Standard of St. <hi>Mark</hi> advance to the Walls, followed by the brave Doge, who cauſed himſelf to be lead to the Aſſault: And at the ſame time, by his Example and Heroick Courage, he drew the reſt after him; for this ſight gave ſo much both of Shame and Courage to the other Gallies, who ſtood yet aloof, that the Captains and Soldiers fearing they ſhould fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Infamy of having abandoned their General in ſuch a noble Danger, they left playing the good Husband, and rowed with all their force, like reſolute Men expoſing themſelves, to the utmoſt Perils, to gain the Shoar, which they did almoſt all at the ſame time; and throwing themſelves with Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Gallies, every Man as well as he could, ſtriving who ſhould get firſt aſhoar, then ran like ſo many enraged Lions, after their General, to the Aſſault. Never was any thing to be ſeen more furious or terrible; for the Walls on that ſide being loweſt, and having, for ten Days, been continually battered, were in many places ruined; ſo that while ſome ſtrove to enter by the Breaches, others preſented the Scaling Ladders: the number of thoſe who defended the Walls and Breaches far ſurpaſſed that of the Aſſailants; ſo that both the one and the other found a ſtout Reſiſtance: nor did it ſeem probable, that ſuch a ſmall number were capable of ſurmounting ſuch a difficult Enterpriſe; nor, in probability, had it ſucceeded, but that, all of a ſuddain, the great Standard of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was ſeen planted, and flying upon one of the Towers, no Man, to this day, being ever able to give an Account how, or by whom it was carried thither.</p>
                  <p>This made the Soldiers aſſume new Courage; for, according to the humour of thoſe Times, the Superſtition whereof, which was ſo advantageous to them, the wiſe Captains knew very well how to improve, they believed that S. <hi>Mark</hi> fought for them, and commanded them to follow him; and the Enemies aſtoniſhed to to ſee it, loſt both their Judgment, and their Courage; ſo that, believing that the City was taken, and that the <hi>French</hi> were upon their Backs, they forſook the Walls, and giving all for loſt, ran to ſecure themſelves in their Houſes: ſo that the <hi>Venetians</hi> finding no more Reſiſtance, ſiezed upon a great part of the Walls, and made themſelves Maſters of twenty five of the hundred and ten Towers which were on the ſide of the Haven; and when they ſaw the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had recovered their Conſternation, return, with the Soldiers of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in a prodigious number, and good Order, to diſlodge them, ſinding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, with ſo ſmall a Force, to be able to maintain their Poſt againſt ſo many Enemies, they ſet fire to the adjacent Houſes; which being driven with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Violence, by a ſtrong North Wind which then blew, the whirling Flames were carried full in the Faces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which obliged them to ſtop, and endeavour by all Means, immediately to extinguiſh the Fire.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64918:141"/>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> All this time the <hi>French</hi> made prodigious Attempts on their ſide, to gain the double Wall which they attacked near the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs.</hi> Of the ſix Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talious, thoſe two which were commanded by the Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew de Montmorency,</hi> were placed in Battalia between the City and the Camp, as well to guard it from Surpriſe, as to ſuſtain thoſe who made the Attack. The four others, commanded by the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother, the Counts of <hi>Blois</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> gave a furious Aſſault to the out Wall, which was vigorouſly defended by the ſtranger Soldiers, whoſe Courage was quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> the Combat was long and obſtinately maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both Sides; the Engines all this time playing with horrible Fury, and one of the Towers, which was half overthrown by Mining, and a part of the Wall, was gained; fifteen brave Knights, with two ſtout Soldiers, being the firſt that mounted them, preſently planting their Enſigns there; they fought for ſome time with their Swords and Battle-Axes, againſt thoſe, who in great Numbers came to diſlodge them, but not receiving timely Succors, being oppreſſed by Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, they were at laſt forced to leap from the Walls, leaving two of their Company Priſoners with the Enemies, who immediately carried them to the Emperor as a mighty Pawn of an aſſured Victory. But the News which was at the ſame time brought of the good Succeſs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> on their ſide, gave ſo much Joy, and ſo inflamed the Hearts of the <hi>French</hi> with Courage and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that they renewed the Attack with more Fury than before, till ſuch time as a terrible Cloud of Duſt, which advanced towards them from the Weſt, and the ſound of the Trumpets, the neighing of Horſes, and the noiſe of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of People, which they heard, but could not well deſcern, obliged them to quit the Aſſault, and put themſelves in a poſture of Defence.</p>
                  <p>It was the Emperor <hi>Alexis,</hi> who compelled by the Cries and the Murmurs of the People and Soldiers, who openly reproached him with his Cowardice, and by the Fear which he had, leſt they ſhould fall upon him and pull him in pieces, was at laſt ſallied out of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with above ſixty great Battalions, ſuſtained by all his Cavalry, to charge the Army in the Rere, if they ſhould continue the Aſſault, or to give them Battle in the open Field if they ſhould dare to expect it, not doubting in the leaſt, but that he ſhould be able to ſurround them, and cut them in pieces; it being very improbable that ſix Battalions wearied with a deſperate Aſſault, ſhould be able to reſiſt ſixty of freſh Men, the leaſt of which was incomparably greater than the biggeſt of the other. For this reaſon the Princes, that they might not be attacked but in Front, ranged their Troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Barriers and Paliſado's of their Camp, at the Foot of the Hill of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querneſs,</hi> reſolving there, firmly to expect and receive their Enemies, without being the leaſt aſtoniſhed at their Numbers; which, by Experience, they knew conſiſted in a great many Men, but a few Soldiers. In the Front ſtood the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Croſs-bows, who were ſuſtained by a ſeventh Battalion, compoſed of two hundred Knights, who were Diſmounted; The other ſix Bodies followed according to their Order, which they had always obſerved ſince their Paſſage over the <hi>Boſphorus;</hi> there were ſome Companies left in the Camp, to prevent its being ſurprized, during the Combat. As they were thus drawing up their Troops, the Army received, with incredible Joy, the Reinforcement which the generous <hi>Henry Dandolo</hi> brought to their Aſſiſtance; for having underſtood that the Emperor had made this Sally, he cauſed himſelf to be immediately Conducted to the Camp, which was at no great Diſtance from his Poſt, with all the Force which he could rally, drawing what could be ſpared from the Towers which he had taken, and proteſting that he would live and die with his Brethren and brave Companions in Armes.</p>
                  <p>That which was ſtill more favourable to the Confederate Army, was, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had no other General, but this miſerable cowardly <hi>Alexis;</hi> for by a little Frieque of Jealouſy and Glory, and by a ſottiſh Vanity, he would not ſuffer his Son-in-Law <hi>Theodore Laſcaris,</hi> to make one in the Sally; for had he Commanded, being both a Soldier and a Captain, he would with Advantage againſt ſo few Enemies, have made uſe of that infinite Number of Hands, which remained wholly Unprofitable that Day, by reaſon that their Commander had neither Courage nor Skill enough to manage them to the beſt Advantage. And in realli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> as he came only with the Hope that he ſhould be able to Oppreſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with Multitude, by ſurrounding them on all Sides, being advanced within the Diſtance of the Darts and Arrows, which began already to fly from one ſide to the other; ſo ſoon as he ſaw that they would not ingage in the open Field, or be drawn from their Retrenchments, he never durſt take the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage once to Attack them, but with a ſhameful Cowardice cauſed the Retreat to be ſounded, and towards Evening, took the Way towards the City with his great Army, that little Handful of Men having the Confidence to follow him for ſome time, in good Order, diſcharging continually upon his Rere, he never once turning Head to give them Battle, as he might have done in the open Field. However to hide his Shame, and ſhelter himſelf from the Reproaches of the People, for this cowardly Action, he told them, as he entred the City, that he had deferred the Combat by reaſon it was ſo late, and that the next Morning he was reſolved to attack the Enemies in their Camp, if they had the Courage to expect him. But at laſt, as when once Fear and Diſpair have once ſeized upon the Heart of a Man, eſpecially an ill Man, and that he hath the War which his Guilt hath raiſed in his Soul, though he were ſurrounded with all the Forces of the Earth, and though he have no other Enemy to Combat beſides himſelf and his own Fear, yet will he think of nothing but flying, and how to ſave himſelf; Thus this unworthy Prince, purſued by his own Conſcience, inſtead of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the Encounter the next Morning, ſecretly embarked himſelf at the Port of the great Palace, with a few of his Domeſticks, all the Gold, Silver, and the Imperial Ornaments, and fled by the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> and the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, to <hi>Zago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> antiently called <hi>Debeltus,</hi> a City of <hi>Thracia,</hi> at the Foot of Mount <hi>Hemus,</hi> where, by reaſon of his Guilt, his Cowardice, and the Contempt into which he was fallen, having reaſon to fear ſome great Revolution in his Fortune, he had beforehand aſſured himſelf of a Retreat.</p>
                  <p>Before Day, this Flight was diſcovered, and the People deteſting this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cowardice, and fearing moreover, leſt the Army of the <hi>Latins,</hi> making Advantage of this Diſorder, and ſuch a favourable Conjuncture, ſhould by a ſecond Aſſault take the City by Force, ran by Shoals to the Priſon where the Tyrant, after the Eſcape of the young <hi>Alexis,</hi> had cauſed <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be detained; and ſeizing upon the Empreſs <hi>Euphroſine</hi> and her Children, whom the unhappy <hi>Comnenius</hi> had brutiſhly abandoned, his exceſſive Fear having extinguiſhed in his Soul all the Sentiments of Tenderneſs, as a Father and a Husband, they reſolved to Sacrifice them in his Room, to the blind Fury of the People. They inſtantly knock'd off the Manacles of poor <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who had been ſo barbarouſly treated by his own Brother; and Fortune, who plays with the Deſtinies of Men, whom ſhe mounts up and throws down, as ſhe is pleaſed to turn her ſlippery Wheel, continuing her old Trade, ſhe mounted upon the imperial Throne, the ſame <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom about eight years before, ſhe had ſo tragically tumbled out of it. After which, all the Orders of the City, with the Conſent of this poor old Man, who in truth, was nothing but the Shadow of an Emperor, ſent Deputies to the Princes, to give them an account of the happy Change of their Affairs by the Flight of the Uſurper, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Emperor <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to deſire the young Prince to come and take part of the good Fortune, and the Empire of his Father.</p>
                  <p>The Princes pleaſingly ſurprized by a thing ſo little expected, and which was confirmed to them by thoſe who came from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> one after another, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who ſhould be the firſt to joy the young <hi>Alexis</hi> with this good Fortune; yet nevertheleſs acted with their wonted Prudence upon this Occaſion, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no neceſſary Precautions, as being ſuſpicious of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they had no reaſon to truſt; and therefore they followed the Maxim of thoſe, who believe that one can never act more ſecurely than by acting cautiouſly, and early the next Morning drew out the Army in Battalia, as if they had been going to the Combat; and then they acquainted the young <hi>Alexis,</hi> that if this good Fortune of his was true, being procured by their Arms, they did, before any other Marters were conſidered, expect from him an Aſſurance of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Treaty, and that the Emperor his Father, ſhould ratify it to them; whereupon the Mareſhal <hi>de Ville Hardouin,</hi> and <hi>Matthew de Montmorency,</hi> with
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64918:142"/>two <hi>Venetian</hi> Noblemen,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> were diſpatched to that Prince from the Confederates; he received them moſt Ceremoniouſly, and with all manner of Honor and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence imaginable, in the great Hall of the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs.</hi> After which, having in a particular Audience propoſed the Articles to him, though he found them very hard, yet was he ſo Overjoyed to ſee himſelf Re-eſtabliſhed; and ſo fearful to loſe his Empire a ſecond time, if he ſhould make his Deliverers and Benefactors become his Enemies, that he inſtantly ratified them, and cauſed his Letters Patents, with the golden Bulla's, to be expedited, and delivered to the Ambaſſadors, wherein he promiſed, with moſt ſolemn Oaths, that he would inviolably fulfil and perform thoſe Articles of the Treaty. Whereupon the young <hi>Alexis</hi> was conducted by the Princes and Confederate Lords, as it were in Triumph, into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where, after he had been received by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror his Father, and the Empreſs his Mother-in-Law, the Daughter of <hi>Bela,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with all the Marks of Tenderneſs, and thoſe Tranſports of Joy, which it is impoſſible to expreſs, he was aſſociated with his Father in the Empire, and with all Magnificence and Solemnity, upon the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> crowned in the ſtately Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This noble Ceremony being over, as the Confederates had accompliſhed their Part of the Treaty, it was alſo neceſſary that <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould take Care of the performance of his Engagements. And immediately therefore, that he might ſatisfy the Princes in one of the moſt important Articles of the Treaty, he writ mighty handſome Letters to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> in which he renounced the Schiſm of his Anceſtors, and acknowledged him to be Chriſt's Vicar upon Earth, and ſupreme Paſtor and Head of the Univerſal Church; promiſing to render to him and his Succeſſors, that filial Obedience which was their Due; and to employ all his Power to oblige the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to follow his Example, and to re-unite it ſelf to the Head. He alſo obliged the Patriarch to conſent to the Re-union, and to promiſe him, with an Oath, that he would in Perſon go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Pope's Supremacy, and to receive the Pall from his Hands. But theſe were only Letters and Promiſes, and Words, which were very cheap to a <hi>Greek;</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> eaſily, by this Artifice, drew himſelf out of this Article, in regard it was not reaſonable to deſire more from him upon that Point for the preſent; but it was not ſo eaſy for him to diſengage himſelf from the other Articles, in which he had obliged to ſatisfy them with more than Words, to pay them good Money, and furniſh the Troops, which he had promiſed to maintain in the Holy War: But however, he was dexterous enough to deliver himſelf, at leaſt, for ſome time, from thoſe too, hoping ſtill, that if he could but delay the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, Fortune would furniſh him with ſome Convenience or other, wholly to free himſelf from thoſe hard Conditions.</p>
                  <p>After he had therefore, to make a Shew that he acted with great Sincerity, by doing all that he could for the preſent, paid them a conſiderable part of the Money which he owed them; one day, as he was wont, going to make the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Viſit in their Camp, without the Gate, by the Banks of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> he took occaſion to Remonſtrate to them on this Manner; <hi>That he acknowledged himſelf obliged to them for every thing, his Life, his Honor, and his Empire, and that there was nothing which he did ſo paſſionately Deſire, as to manifeſt to them his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by the Performance of what he had promiſed by his Treaty; but that if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Reſolution, they ſhould the next Month quit him, and retire to the Iſle of</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, <hi>in order to the Purſuit of their Voyage to the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>it was abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to ſatisfy his Ingagements, or in ſo ſhort a time to furniſh them with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Shipping, and the Troops which he had promiſed them: That they very well knew he was not firmly eſtabliſhed in his Empire, for, that his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle was ſtill in</hi> Thracia, <hi>where he had a ſtrong Party, who still owned him as Emperor, and that</hi> Theodore Laſcaris <hi>had another alſo on the other ſide the</hi> Boſphorus, <hi>in</hi> Bithynia; <hi>and that for his own particular, it was too evident, that he was extremely hated by the</hi> Greeks <hi>for the Treaty which he had made with them, and that the Antipathy and Hatred which they had to the</hi> Latins, <hi>was ſo great, that the very Diſcourſe of it would make them Sullen and out of Humor; and conſequently, that beſides, that he was not in a Condition to force them to do what was neceſſary for the Accompliſhment of the Treaty, he ſhould by attempting it expoſe himſelf to their Hatred, and poſſibly to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64918:142"/>be outraged by them, and run the manifeſt hazard of loſing the Empire,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> and his Life, together with the poſſibility of giving them the juſt Satisfaction which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; and more eſpecially, if they ſhould find him deſtitute of the powerful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of his Allies, and abandoned by his Protectors. That therefore it was, not only the Honour, but the Intereſt of the Princes, to perfect their Work, and to fix that Throne in Safety, upon which they had re-placed him with ſo much Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory. That all that he requeſted from them was, but for a little time to defer their Voyage, which might prove unſucceſsful, and poſſibly fatal, if they ſhould make too much haſte; for the Winter now approaching, they muſt be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to paſs it in</hi> Syria, <hi>without being able to do any thing; where they would be in danger of loſing their Army for want of Proviſions, which in that tempeſtuous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Seaſon of the Year, they could not expect from</hi> Italy; <hi>nor if they left him in that uncertain State, could he aſſure them of Supplies from</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appeared of abſolute neceſſity, both for their own Affairs and his, to prolong the Confederacy for one Year more; or however, to defer their Voyage till the Spring: And that in that time he hoped to put his Affairs into ſo good a Posture, by their kind Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as not to fear any thing from his Subjects, and to be able, without difficulty, to perform all the Articles of the Treaty, and to accompany them to the Conqueſt of the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>with an Army becoming an Emperor of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>And that in this time he would plentifully furniſh them with whatſoever was requiſite for the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of their Army, and pay the</hi> Venetians <hi>all their Charges in maintaining their Fleet during the War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Alexis</hi> found the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> eaſily inclinable to to comply with it, for they plainly diſcovered in it both his and their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and that no other rational Choice could be made; but there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of propoſing it to thoſe who were under no Obligation longer than <hi>September,</hi> and, it was very probable, would not agree to it. The next Day therefore it was propoſed before the whole Army, and with ſo much force and efficacy, by demonſtrating the ſtrength of the Reaſons which ſupported it, that notwithſtanding all the Endeavours of the diſcontented Party, who had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attempted to divide the Army, who now alſo oppoſed this Offer with all their power, it nevertheleſs paſſed at laſt, by the general Approbation of the whole Army, in favour of the moſt prudent and wholſom Opinion: So that the Confederation was renewed for another Year, and the Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> deferred till the <hi>Eaſter</hi> following. But the Joy of this new Union was much diminiſhed, by the unhappy Loſs which then happened, by the death of the brave <hi>Matthew de Montmorency,</hi> one of the moſt amiable and valiant Knights of <hi>France;</hi> and who, by the glorious Advantages which his Anceſtors, the Lords of that illuſtrious Houſe, had acquired, and by their extraordinary Merits preſerved, was infinitely eſteemed, beloved, and even adored by the Soldiers. He died ſpent with the mighty Toils and Fatigues which he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in that laborious Campaign; and was interred, with a magnificent Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and general Grief, in the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, That they might employ the Remainder of the Year to the beſt advantage, the young Emperor, accompanied with Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> the Count <hi>de St. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> the Brother of Count <hi>Baldwin,</hi> with a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Troops, joyned with a great Army of <hi>Greeks,</hi> marched againſt his Uncle, who had ſiezed upon <hi>Adrianople.</hi> He was eaſily defeated, and forced elſewhere to ſearch for a more ſecure Retreat. After which, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the greateſt part of the Cities of <hi>Thracia</hi> under his Obeyſance; and all the Revolted, both on this and the other ſide the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> except the <hi>Bulgari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who, about twenty Years before, had thrown off the <hi>Grecian</hi> Yoke, under the Conduct of their famous King <hi>Joannize.</hi> The Winter then approaching, he returned full of Glory to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the ſolemn Entry which he made loſt much of its Splendour, by reaſon of the piteous Eſtate to which a dreadful Conflagration, during his Abſence, had reduced the Capital City of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; which happened in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Among the great number of Strangers of all Nations who traded at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> there were a many rich <hi>Saraſin</hi> Merchants, to whom the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64918:143"/>by an infamous Avarice,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> leſt they ſhould loſe the Gains they drew from their Commerce, had given liberty to build a <hi>Moſquee,</hi> to the great Scandal of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> who inhabited the City, and to the common People, who, a little before, had pulled down their Houſes. Now it happened that ſome <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Soldiers, joyned with a Company of <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Piſans,</hi> upon whom <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Latins,</hi> and regain their Eſteem, had beſtowed a good Largeſs, after a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch at <hi>Galatha,</hi> they reſolved, either out of Zeal or Revenge, or rather the Heat of Brutiſh Wine, to fall upon the plunder the Houſes and <hi>Moſquee</hi> of theſe <hi>Saraſins.</hi> The <hi>Saraſins,</hi> at firſt ſurprized by the unexpectedneſs of the Action, gave way to the Out-rage; but ſeeing themſelves ſupported by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who from all Quarters ran to their Defence, they took heart upon the matter, and in a Crowd flew upon this ſmall number of Mad-men who attacked them in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; and charging them at once with Curſes, and luſty Blows, they repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and put them to flight: But ſome or other among theſe Brutes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately mad to ſee themſelves thus diſappointed of the Booty, and beaten too, and it may be, to give a ſtop to thoſe who purſued them, and would have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſeverely, if they had fallen into the hands of an incenſed Rabble, they ſet fire to ſome Wooden Houſes which were upon the Key; and immediately getting into their Barks, they repaſſed the Gulph. It is impoſſible to expreſs the horrible Ravage this dreadful Fire made, for expanding its Flames in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in theſe Tinder Buildings, it attacked the next with a horrible Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and inſtantly leaping from them to others, it run on in a Train like Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, from Street to Street, till it became ſo maſterleſs and raging, that there ſeemed no Remedy for a Miſchief which looked as if it proceeded from ſome ſupernatural Cauſe; and, in ſhort, it ſurmounted all the Power and Induſtry of Men, nothing being able to give a Check to its Force and Violence; for, as if ſome malicious Demons had managed it, one might behold the rowling Flames ſend out, as it were, their Detachments from the main Body of the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and terribly throw themſelves over the Tops of the Houſes, croſs the Streets, to a great diſtance, and inſtantly ſetting thoſe all in a terrible Blaze, as if they acted by Conſent, turn back again, and re-joyn with the main Fire from whence they came, conſuming all that they had thus ſurrounded between them. It happened alſo, by a kind of Prodigy, the Hand of God ſeeming to be ſtretched out againſt this unfortunate City, that the Wind which before blew from the North, and carried the Flames to the South, as far as the <hi>Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> came about to the South and South-Weſt, and carried the Fire into the other Quarters of the City, which before ſeemed out of danger, by lying from the Wind. So that the Fire, which began about the middle of the Haven, being puſhed, by theſe contrary Winds, higher to the Weſt and North, extended its Rage from Sea to Sea, above a League, paſſing by the famous Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> without touching it; the furious Element ſeeming to pay a Reſpect, even in its greateſt Violence, to that goodly Pile, at the ſame time that it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted no Compaſſion to the great and wealthy Streets of the Merchants which were round about it, nor the Palaces, or other Churches, or the proud and ſtately Edifices of the Imperial Place of the great <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> all which, in a little time, were reduced to Ruines, Rubbidge and Cynders.</p>
                  <p>Such a horrible Conflagration, which continued all that Night, and the two following Days, in its full Rage and Fury, and which was not in a Weeks time wholly extinguiſhed, was a moſt miſerable Spectacle to the Princes, who, from the Eminencies of <hi>Galatha,</hi> ſaw with an extream Trouble, what was not in theirs, nor any Humane Power to help. One may ſay, however, that it was a Preſage of the Ruin of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, whom God was pleaſed thus to puniſh for ſo many infamous Treaſons which they had plotted and executed againſt the <hi>Latins</hi> in the firſt <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and to tranſlate their Empire to the <hi>French,</hi> as he did preſently after, in the manner which I am going to relate.</p>
                  <p>There was at the Court of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a Lord of the firſt Quality of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Houſe of <hi>Ducas,</hi> nearly related to the Emperors, whoſe Name was <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis,</hi> and commonly called <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> by reaſon that his Eye-brows joyning, and very thick, hung over his Eyes; which hath always been looked upon as a Mark of a very ill Man: And in truth, one ſhall difficultly find one in all Hiſtory more
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64918:143"/>wicked, or who had a blacker Soul, a Nature more ſavage and cruel,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> or more capable of the moſt baſe and cowardly Treaſons, to come to the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Ends. Now, as he was the moſt inſatiably ambitious of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he eaſily perſuaded himſelf, that, after the Example of <hi>Alexis Comnenius,</hi> whom he had ſerved againſt <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he might make himſelf Emperor, provided he durſt undertake the Enterpriſe, without ſcrupling the greateſt Crimes, to lay hold quickly of the Opportunity which ſeemed to favour his wicked Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, conſidering in what manner of Diſpoſition the Spirits of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were at preſent, in regard to the two Emperors and the <hi>Latins.</hi> And certainly, as for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> beſides that he had ever been one of the moſt fantaſtical Men in the World, and leaſt capable of Governing, as may be ſeen by his Character, which I have given in the fifth Book of this Hiſtory, he ſeemed, by his Impriſonment, to have loſt all that little Soul which he had before; for he acted and ſaid ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extravagant things, after he had once entertained theſe crazed Imaginations, that he was guilty of the moſt pleaſant Dotage in the World; for he ſancied that he was deſtined, one day, to be the Univerſal Monarch of the World, and that he ſhould alſo recover his Sight, together with the Vigour and Beauty of a flouriſhing Youth, and become, in a manner, a Demi-God. This was confirmed to him by his Aſtrologers, who made a mere Fool of him, and by the Monks of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> the moſt of which, ſince their Schiſm, had ſhaken hands with Truth, Honour and good Manners, and ſtudied nothing ſo much as the ſervile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Art of Flattering their Emperors, even in their moſt ſottiſh Follies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to procure good Entertainment for their Bellies, which was the chief thing which theſe lazy Cheats and Hypocrites regarded. Theſe Extravagancies of the poor old Dotard brought him into the very laſt degrees of Contempt with the People, who made no manner of account of him, and in all publick Ceremonies and Tranſactions, boldly named his Son before him. Nor was the Son in much better Terms, in the Opinion of his Subjects, than the Father; for, by reaſon of the Confederacy which he had made with the <hi>Latins,</hi> they had changed that Love which before they had for him, into the moſt implacable Hatred: the very name of the <hi>Latins</hi> was ſo odious to them, that they could not hear it without Grief and Horrour, eſteeming them the Cauſe of all their Miſeries, and thoſe Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which were made to ſatisfie the Treaty. And to augment this Deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the laſt Deſolation of their City, they knew, was wholly owing to thoſe lewd Fellows whom they protected in their Army, although it was no fault of the Princes that Juſtice was not done upon them; but ſo long as they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concealed, the impoſſibility of Diſcovery who were the Authors of that horrible Fact, which protected them from the Hand of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> therefore, to make his Advantage of this great Averſion which the People had for the Emperors, believed that his firſt Step was, by Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to ingratiate himſelf with the diſcontented Multitude: And this was no difficult matter; for it was no more but his declaring himſelf a mortal Enemy of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and he was ſure of the People. And the next thing was, to find ſome way to create a Difference between the young Emperor and the Princes; but yet ſo, as that the Quarrel with the <hi>Latins</hi> might not diminiſh the People's Hatred againſt the Emperor, which ſuch a Difference, he foreſaw, would be apt to do. This, indeed, ſeemed no eaſie matter to do; but yet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the difficulty, he found the opportunity, in a little time, to effect it. For this purpoſe, being a Man of a moſt ſupple and ſmooth Converſation, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, complaiſant and aſſiduous; and beſides, having got the Reputation of being a Man of Spirit and Courage, he preſently conveyed himſelf into the Eſteem and Affections of <hi>Alexis:</hi> Inſomuch, that the young Prince, who had not too much Soul, nor was over-burdened with the Talent of Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, made this wicked Traitor his only Confident; and that he might have him conſtantly near his Perſon, he made him the great Maſter of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe. The inſinuating <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> being thus got into his Boſom, made uſe of all the Artifices which an ambitious Cheat could invent, to render the Prince jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the <hi>Latins</hi> odious and ſuſpected to him, and to efface out of his Mind all the Obligations of his Benefactors; and, in ſhort, to oblige him to an open Breach, and to declare War againſt them; pretending that he did not doubt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64918:144"/>but to be able to furniſh him with all things neceſſary for the carrying it on,

                  <p>He laboured, however, ſome time in vain, in regard that though he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mighty Aſcendant upon the feeble Spirit of the Prince, yet that very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, which had delivered him up into his Hands, to diſpoſe of him at his pleaſure, proved the main Obſtacle to his Deſign. For the Prince, who was thoroughly acquainted with the Courage of the Confederates, was in the moſt dreadful Apprehenſions of Fear, that if he ſhould render thoſe, who had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed him in the Throne, his Enemies, he ſhould certainly ſink under the Power and the Juſtice of their Arms: And this Fear was much too predominant for all the other Paſſions with which this Traytor endeavoured to poſſeſs and fortifie his Soul. But as there is nothing ſo proper to beget, in low and debaſed Minds, Preſumption, Ingratitude, Oblivion of good Offices, and take off even the fear of Vengeance, as Proſperity, which many times, by a ſtrange kind of Injuſtice, makes Men ſeek for the Opportunities of defeating thoſe to whom they owe it, and quitting the Score of Obligations by the Payment of Injuries; ſo did it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <hi>Alexis:</hi> For, ſo ſoon as he was returned from the <hi>Thracian</hi> Expedition, which was ſo much to his Glory and Advantage, <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> preſently fell to his old Trade of buzzing into his Ears, That he had now nothing further to fear: That he was as abſolute Maſter of the Empire as he could wiſh: That now he might eaſily quit himſelf of this handful of <hi>Latins,</hi> who had only been ſtrong, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> were weak with their own Inteſtine Diviſions: That under the ſpecious name of Protectors, they covered the moſt cruel Tyranny over himſelf and Subjects, by inſiſting upon the performance of thoſe ſhameful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and inſupportable Articles, which, making Advantage of his Fortune, they had extorted from him. And, in ſhort, by his Sollicitations, he ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the young Emperor, elated by his little Proſperity, that he brought him to the Reſolution of ſhaking off the Yoke, as he called it, which he had impoſed upon his own Neck; and to endeavour to deſtroy thoſe who had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him.</p>
                  <p>The Princes quickly perceived by his Carriage, wholly differing from what it uſed to be, that there was a manifeſt Change; but in a ſhort time they plainly diſcovered, that, beſides the Intention which he had to perform nothing of what he had promiſed, he alſo ſought all Opportunities of deſtroying them by ſome ſuddain Surpriſe; and therefore they reſolved to oblige him to deal clearly with them, and either to give them juſt Satisfaction, or to declare War. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent ſix Deputies, three <hi>French,</hi> and three <hi>Venetians,</hi> who received their Audience of the Emperors in the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs;</hi> where <hi>Conon de Bethune,</hi> who ſpoke for them all, addreſſed himſelf to the young Emperor, with whom only they had treated, and ſpoke to him in a manner extreamly bold and Majeſtick, in theſe Terms. <hi>My Lord, We come hither in behalf of the Princes and Lords of the</hi> Cruſade, <hi>both</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Venetians, <hi>to let you underſtand, that after the great and ſignal Services, which all the World knows we have rendred to you, they have it in extream Admiration that you ſhould do nothing for their Satisfaction, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Treaty which you your ſelf have ſworn to perform, and which the Emperor, your Father, hath alſo ratified. They have often required of you the performance of thoſe Stipulations; and we do here, this day, in their Names, peremptorily require you, for the laſt time, to be at laſt Maſter of your Word, and preſently to accompliſh the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of your Treaty, without longer abuſing of their Patience: If you do, you ſhall do only what you are obliged to do, which is the only Satisfaction they expect from you: But if you refuſe, we are, from them, to declare to you, that they will do themſelves Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by the ſame Arms which have been ſo auſpicious to you; and that from hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they will eſteem you their Enemy, and declare War againſt you; which they were reſolved not to begin, till they had given you this ſolemn Defiance, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of their Country, which does not allow them to ſteal a Victory by ſurprizing their Enemies, but which they reſolve to gain nobly, by defying you to the Combat. This, my Lord, is what we have in Commiſſion to ſay to you. We have, I think, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained our Intentions; it remains on your part, immediately to give your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to let us know which part you chuſe, whether Peace or War.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> This Declaration, ſo frank and generous, and delivered with a noble Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being what was very uncuſtomary in the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, immediately rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a fearful Tumult in the Hall, where all began to exclaim, that this was an inſufferable Violation of the Majeſty of the Emperors, to talk with ſo much Confidence and Inſolence; and to deſie them, even upon the Throne, was an Attempt, which, ſince the Foundation of the Empire, never any Perſon before had the Preſumption to execute. Above all, the young Emperor was the lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt; and foaming with Madneſs and Choler, broke out into moſt outrageous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: Inſomuch, that they who before had declared themſelves moſt highly in favour of the <hi>Latins,</hi> now appeared the moſt heated and violent againſt them. In the mean time, whilſt the Debate was hot what Meaſures were to be taken, and that nothing was to be heard but the fearful and confuſed Cries of People, who were all Speakers, the Deputies ſeeing there was no Concluſion, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to be expected, but rather ſome Indignities and Outrages to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they gently deſcended from the Hall, and preſently mounting on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, returned to the Camp; and now nothing was thought on by either ſide, but the enſuing War.</p>
                  <p>It was immediately begun by little Skirmiſhes between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> wherein the laſt always carried the Advantage. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> believing that the main of their Succeſs depended upon deſtroying the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, and that if they could effect that, it was impoſſible for the Confederates to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt long, but that they ſhould have them, in a little time, at their Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they therefore reſolved to attempt the ſiring of the Navy, as they lay at Anchor in the Gulph. They therefore took ſeventeen great Veſſels of a long Built, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Chelandies,</hi> which they were accuſtomed to make uſe of for Fire-Ships: Theſe they filled with Faggots, and all ſorts of Combuſtible Materials, and eſpecially with Barrels of Roſin, Pitch and Greaſe, to put to them their <hi>Greek</hi> Fire, or Wild-Fire, when the time ſhould ſerve. This Wild-Fire was called <hi>Greek</hi> Fire, by reaſon that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were the firſt that made uſe of it. It was invented about the ſeventh Century, by an Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Callinicus,</hi> who made ſuch admirable uſe of it in the famous Battle, which the Admirals of the Navy of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine Pogonatus</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> near <hi>Cizicum,</hi> upon the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi> that he burnt their whole Fleet, and thirty thouſand Men which were aboard it, in the midſt of the Sea; for it was the property of this Fire, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to burn till it came to the Water, but to burn in the Water, which ſeemed to increaſe its Force and Violence; and by a Prodigy, quite contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe two Elements, which are Enemies one to the other, it ſeemed to make uſe of it for its Food and Nouriſhment. It had alſo a Movement wholly contrary to that of common Fire, which always raiſeth it ſelf, and with its pointed Head, aſpires upward, as it were, tending to its Sphere: But this joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its extream Quickneſs, the property of heavy and Terreſtrial Bodies burnt downwards, and all along to the Right and Left, with an Impetuoſity proportionable to the Impreſſion which it received from thoſe who had the Art to manage it; for they might either throw it a great diſtance, by the Machines, which were made for that purpoſe, after the ſame manner as they threw Darts and great Stones; or they might blow it by long Trunks and Pipes of Copper, through which they diſcharged this liquid Fire, with Impetuoſity, like Water out of a Syringe, either againſt Men, or any thing which they intended to ſet on fire; and where it once laid hold, it would ſtick ſo faſt, that there was no way to extinguiſh it, but with Vinegar, mingled with Urine and Sand; or, which is more wonderful, Oyl, which is the proper Nouriſhment of other Fire, and which makes it more quick and violent, would extinguiſh this. Thus Art, whoſe Perfection, we commonly ſay, conſiſts in the Imitation of Nature, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more admirable, than when, in its Operations, it is ſo far from imitating her, that it beſtows upon them Properties wholly different, and even contrary to thoſe of Nature. For the main, this wondrous Fire was compoſed of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Naphta, Pitch, the Gums of certain Trees, and Bitumen, tempered with the Water of a Fountain which had this particular Quality, and ſome other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, which ſerved to produce this marvellous Effect. But this Invention
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64918:145"/>is now quite loſt,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1203</label> particularly ſince that of Powder was found out, with which we make all our Artificial Fires, and which produces by our Cannons, Bombes and Mines, Effects incomparably more wonderful and terrible than thoſe of this <hi>Grecian Fire,</hi> with its Engines, Blaſts and Pipes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> having in this manner prepared their ſeventeen great Fire-Ships, and charged them with the Wild-fire, one Night, when the Wind blew for their purpoſe, a good ſtiff Gale at Weſt, they ſent them adrift towards the middle of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, which lay to the Leeward, at the Entrance of the Haven. All theſe Ships, having a Stern Wind, and all their Sails filled with it, appeared in an inſtant all on fire, like ſo many glowing Furnaces, driven before the Wind with mighty Violence, upon the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet; and advancing ſtill with their whirling Flames towards them, ſeemed ready to ſet them on fire, there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſtant Spectators, almoſt no poſſibility of avoiding the threatning danger. All the City ran to the Port, and to the Towers and Walls, to have the pleaſure of the burning of the Navy, every one impatiently expecting the agreeable Show which they believed was ready to appear, and all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as upon an Amphitheatre, clapping their Hands, and making great Shouts of Joy, with a moſt horrible Noiſe, as if all had been their own. But this Joy was quickly changed into Shame and Grief, when they ſaw all theſe artificial Fires, from which they ſtood gaping for ſuch Miracles, vaniſh into Smoak, by the Skill and Dexterity of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, ſo ſoon as they ſaw them, leap'd into their Skiffs and Long-Boats, and, with an incredible diligence, having run the Fire-Ships one upon another, in deſpight of all the Showers of Darts and Arrows, which were diſcharged upon them, by the force of mighty Hooks and Grappling Irons, they drew them out of the Port, into the Chanal, where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to the Wind and Current, they were carried into the <hi>Propontis,</hi> where at length they ſpent themſelves in unprofitable Flames. So that the <hi>Venetians</hi> loſt not ſo much as one Skiff; nor was there more than one ſingle Merchant-man of <hi>Piſa,</hi> which being unluckily in their Way, could not ſo ſuddenly avoid them, but that ſhe was quite burnt down.</p>

                  <p>Poor <hi>Alexis</hi> immediately fell into the Snare, which was ſo artfully placed for him, for he inſtantly diſpatched Envoys, charged with this Commiſſion, to the Princes; when, at the ſame time, the Traytor having, by his Emiſſaries, blazed it all about the City, he, that very Day, being the 25th of <hi>January,</hi> raiſed ſuch a furious and general Inſurrection throughout the Town, that believing themſelves betrayed, after having, with the greateſt Inſolence, charged the Emperor with a thouſand Imprecations, calling him a Slave to the <hi>Latins,</hi> and a Traytor to the Empire, they ran tumultuouſly to the Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> there preſently to make Choice of a new Emperor. The Hiſtorian <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who was at that time Lord Chancellor, although he does, with Paſſion enough, declare himſelf an Enemy to the <hi>Latins,</hi> yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, did whatever lay in his Power to oppoſe this Reſolution; remonſtrating to the People, that they were in no manner of Condition to defend the Emperor whom they ſhould chuſe, againſt the Army of the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades.</hi> But the Populace, which after it is once heated, is no longer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reaſon, or of following any other Conduct, but that of their

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> cried out terribly that they would never ſtir from thence till they had a new Emperor; and in the Heat of the Tumult ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the moſt Eniment Perſons of the City, they endeavoured to conſtrain them, even with Menaces and the Ponyard at their Throats to accept of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown. At laſt ſeeing that all the Ancient Senators to whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves, as moſt capable of governing, excuſed themſelves upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretences, they took a young man of a good Houſe, whoſe name was <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Cannabus,</hi> and notwithſtanding all that he could do to oppoſe it, they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Imperial Throne which was in the Body of the Church upon the right ſide over againſt the Tribunal and proclaimed him Emperor, compelling the Patriarch alſo to Crown him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexis</hi> aſtoniſhed at this News, ran to conſult his Oracle, the Traitor, and he reſolving to puſh his Treaſon to the utmoſt, to the end that he might procure himſelf to be elected Emperor in the place of <hi>Cannabus,</hi> got a Deputation inſtantly for himſelf to go to the Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> to whom he promiſed, on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who implored his Aſſiſtance in this preſſing Neceſſity, to deliver to him the Palace and Fortreſs of <hi>Blaquerneſs,</hi> as a pawn of his Fidelity, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he would inſtantly come with all his Forces to deliver him out of this extreme Danger in which he was. The Marquis not doubting but that the reſt of the Princes would be in this particular in his opinion accepted the Propoſition; but before he had the Leiſure to conferre with them, the Perfidious <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned, failed not the Night following to advertiſe the Principal Perſons of the City and of the Militia of this Treaty: And as he had a great Party of his Friends and Relations, ſo having aſſured himſelf of the Guards of Strangers, by the Lord Treaſurers Intereſt whom he had gained, he cauſed the People to be put in Arms before the Palace, to hinder the Effect of this Treaſon of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who as they were made to believe, had ſold the City to the <hi>Latins,</hi> and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matters he took upon him ſo to order them, that they ſhould have nothing to fear; then the Traitor making uſe of the Power which his Place about the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror gave him, entred at Midnight into the Bed-chamber where the poor Prince was faſt aſleep, without dreaming of his horrible Treachery; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly awakned him, and with a trembling Voice, intercepted with Sighs, as if he had been quite out of his Senſes, he told him that all was loſt, that all the City was in Arms, that the Commonalty, the Nobility and Gentry with the Guards were all ready to fall upon the Palace with intent to cut him in Pieces, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood by ſome of their Spies, who were come from the Camp, that he had a Deſign to deliver up the City to the <hi>Latins.</hi> Whereupon the amazed Prince wholly abandoning himſelf to the Conduct of <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> that Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Villain, who preſſed him to ſave himſelf, throwing about him a Morning Gown, he carried him through many windings into a ſtrait Place, in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt obſcure part of the Palace, whither he was no ſooner come, but he found men poſted by this wicked Traitor, who inſtantly ſeized upon him, and clapping Irons upon his Hands and Feet, dragged him into the moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Priſon that was in that place.</p>
                  <p>This being done he went and immediately preſented himſelf to the People, and in a cunning <hi>Harangue</hi> gave them an Account of what had paſſed, and what he had done to deliver them from the terrible Danger wherein they were, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Liberty; he exhorted them generouſly with their Arms to aſſiſt him in preſerving it, and the Glory of the Empire againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and to chuſe an Emperor, who had Courage to defend them againſt theſe Tyrants, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to oppreſs them. Hereupon the Guards, and all thoſe who were of his Faction having ſaluted him Emperor with mighty Acclamations, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are wont in Tumults, blindly to take thoſe Impreſſions which are given them, did ſo too, never thinking of the poor <hi>Cannabus,</hi> the late Idol of their own making, who was preſently by this new Tyrant Unemperor'd again, and ſent to the Priſon from the Throne, to bear <hi>Alexis</hi> Company. As for that other <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> of an Emperor the miſerable <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was deſperately Sick, when the news was brought him of this ſuddain Revolution, he died in a few hours after, either of Fear or Grief, or as ſome believe, by the Cruelty of <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> whoſe Impatience of Competitors, or even the Shadow of them, would not permit him

                  <p>Then ſeeing that he ſhould be ſeconded by his Party, he charged with ſo much Fury upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were already in Diſorder, that they all took the Rout and followed the Emperour, who to make more haſt in his Flight, lightned himſelf of his Buckler and his Arms, and yet notwithſtanding had like to have left his Life too behind him, had it not been for the Swiftneſs of an excellent Horſe, to whoſe Heels and the Spurs of his own Fear, he that day owed his Life. He left however twenty of the moſt principal Men of his Army among the Slain, together with a great Number of private Soldiers, and many Priſoners with all his Baggage; and that which moſt rejoyced the Army was, that together with the Great Standard of the Empire, they took that famous Image of the Bleſſed Virgin, which the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperors, were accuſtomed to have carried before them in all their Battles as the invincible Companion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Nicetas</hi> ſaith, who tells us that the Emperor <hi>Zimiſces</hi> after he had conquered the <hi>Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> cauſed it to be carried in the Triumphant Chariot, which was prepared for himſelf, proteſting that it was to the Virgin repreſented by that Image, to whom he ought to render that Honor, ſince to her he owed the Victory. However the taking of this Banner and Image was looked upon as a happy Preſage that they ſhould gain the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſince the Bleſſed Virgin, to whom that Imperial City was dedicated by the mighty <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſeemed to forſake it to paſs into the <hi>French</hi> Camp, as it were to guide and conduct them in their Entrance into the City. <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> aſtoniſhed with this Blow, began now to think of attempting the ways of Artifice, having for that purpoſe obtained a Conference with the Doge of <hi>Venice;</hi> but with all his Arts he was not able to delude this clear ſighted, blind old man, who by the Eyes of his Soul ſaw through all his Juggles and Slight of Hand. So that all things were prepared to give a general Aſſault upon the City by Sea; for in regard that on that ſide there was only a ſingle Wall, it was believed that the <hi>French,</hi> who were to land upon the Key, making their Attack there, whileſt at the ſame time the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould make theirs by ſighting upon their Ships, the place might ſoon and moſt eaſily be carried.</p>

And as he imagined that the <hi>Latins</hi> intended to ſtorm the City, he forgot nothing that might contribute to its Defence; he fortified the Walls and Towers; he raiſed them where they were low with Parapets, made of ſtrong Timber and floored with boards two or three Stories high, that ſo his men might under Shelter diſcharge upon the Aſſailants. All the Curtain and the Platforms of the Towers, were ſtored with ſuch a great number of all kinds of Engines, that one could ſcarcely believe there was in the whole World a City ſo well fortified and provided, or which could be more difficult to be taken. But the Princes who were not much concerned at theſe Preparations, knowing they ſignified nothing unleſs they were defended by men of Courage, after they had laboured in making all things ready, till Thurſday, the Week after mid-lent, upon that day, being the eighth of <hi>April,</hi> they cauſed all the Army to be imbarked upon the Ships which were ranged into two Lines, extending half a League in their Front.</p>
                  <p>The Great Ships were in the firſt with their long Ladders in manner of a Draw-Bridge, which were faſtned to the Maſts and the Wooden Towers of an extraordinary Height. The Gallies and Flat Bottoms were in the Second, and were to advance through the Intervals which were left between Ship and Ship. Early in the next Morning all the Fleet weighed, and with the Help of Sails and Oars, croſſing the Gulph in good Order, they preſented themſelves before the Walls: They had all the Succeſs they could have hoped; for in Deſpight of the Diſcharge of the Enemies Engines, and the Infinite number of Darts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which were powered upon them from the Curtain and the Towers, thoſe who were aboard the Gallies and the flat Bottoms, obſerving their order of paſſing between the great Ships, got ſafely aſhoar, and planting their Engines all along the Key, they clapt their Ladders to the Walls; and then the great Ships coming up cloſe, the <hi>Venetians</hi> throwing out their Bridges made of Maſts and Yards, placed them againſt the Towers, and both the one and the other mounting Courageouſly went to the Aſſault with their Swords in their Hands. The Combat was maintained on both ſides with an Incredible Fury; the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants animated by the Ardent Deſire which they had, and the certain hope they entertained that they ſhould that day take the richeſt City in the World: And the Defendants forced by the Neceſſity whereto they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either to Vanquiſh or loſe all. But in Concluſion the number of theſe Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Defendants being Infinite in Compariſon of the Aſſailants, and the Emperor who had pitched his Tents in a ſpacious place upon a riſing Ground in the City, near the Walls, continually ſending freſh Supplies, to refreſh thoſe who were weary, and the Towers which he had raiſed upon the Walls ſurpaſſing thoſe Wooden ones to which they had applyed the ſcaling Ladders; ſo that the <hi>Greeks</hi> fought with all manner of Advantage in diſcharging their Darts, Arrows and ſtones from the higher place, the Aſſailants were every where repulſed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three of the Clock in the Afternoon they were forced to retreat with the loſs of many Soldiers and a great many Engines of Battery. This ill ſucceſs did a little trouble the Princes, but it was ſo far from abating their Courage, that it raiſed it much higher, by inflaming it with a generous Deſpight to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to yield to thoſe whom they had ſo often beaten. And the ſame Night they held a Councel of War, where it was reſolved that all things ſhould be diſpoſed within two days, to give a ſecond Aſſault upon the ſame ſide, and not on that of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> propoſed, in regard that part of the City was not ſo well fortified; for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who better underſtood the Sea, made them apprehend, that if they once went out of the Port, the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64918:147"/>would undoutedly carry them into the Chanal of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> and that it was impoſſible to ſtem the Courſe of the Sea, or to bring the Ships near to the Walls. They therefore only added to the order which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved in the Aſſault, that there ſhould not now be one Ship alotted to each Tower, but two tied together, that thereby they might be able to attack the great numbers which defended the Towers, with greater Force than could be expected from the Soldiers of one ſingle Ship; It was alſo reſolved that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be intermixed with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> both by Sea and Land, that ſo the two Nations might not lay the Blame of a Miſcarriage if any ſhould happen upon one another. Upon Munday therefore the twelth of <hi>April,</hi> they came to the Aſſault with greater Vigor, reſolution and ſierceneſs than before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they ſaw all the Towers and the Walls covered with an Infinite of Soldiers. This conſident Approach ſtruck a Terror into the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who believed they ſhould have terrified the Aſſailants with that number or men, and little expected the <hi>Latins</hi> would ſo ſuddainly make another Attempt, of which they ſo aſſured themſelves, that they had ſpent the two days with great rejoycings, and abundance of Bonſires, for the Joy of the Victory.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſault was extremely furious, and continued a long time without the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> advancing any thing more than in the firſt Aſſault or giving it over for the obſtinate reſiſtance with which they met; they ſought on both ſides every where with an equal deſire and reſolution of being the Victors, and the advantage ſeemed till noon to continue with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but then a Gale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Norward, proved mighty favourable to the Aſſailants, by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ships cloſe up to the very Walls; Whereupon two great Ships, one called the Pilgrim, the other the Paradiſe, being tied together by a good Omen for the Cruſades, having on board of them among other <hi>French</hi> Lords, the Biſhops of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and <hi>Troyes,</hi> were carried ſo near to a Tower adjoyning to the Hill where the Tyrant was poſted, that they applied their Bridges and Ladders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty; immediately then two of the moſt Valiant Knights, one a <hi>French</hi> man, whoſe name was <hi>Andrew d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rboiſe,</hi> a Domeſtick of the Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons;</hi> the other a <hi>Venetian,</hi> who was called <hi>Peter Alberti,</hi> mounted courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly well covered with their Shields, and with their Scimiters in their Hands, they both leaped down together into the Tower, and were upon a ſignal imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed by <hi>John de Choiſy</hi> and all the brave men which were aboard thoſe two Ships.</p>
                  <p>It ſome times happens in War, that there is but one ſingle Moment, and one brave Action of ſome Valiant man to decide a day; thoſe who defended this Tower, were ſo terrified with this Heroick Confidence of theſe two men, and much more by the dreadful Blows which they beſtowed, making Heads, Arms and Legs fly off where ever they ſell, that loſing their Courage and Judgement they made all the haſt they could to get out of their reach, and with Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abandoned the Tower to theſe two Heroes and thoſe who thronged up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them with deſire to pertake of the Honor of the Action. Thoſe who ſought aſhoar, and thoſe who were upon the Gallies to ſupport them, ſeeing that thoſe who were aboard theſe two Ships, had planted their Enſigns upon this Tower, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> already took the Fright, were ſo aſhamed to ſee themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand, that ſome of them with Precipitation throwing themſelves aſhoar, whileſt others planted the Ladders againſt the Walls, the one and the other mounting in Shoals, puſhing, overthrowing with their Bucklers, and with huge Blows killing all thoſe, who in this horrible diſorder, into which Fear and Diſpair had driven the <hi>Greeks,</hi> made any reſiſtance; and continually purſuing their Point, with a Courage extremely heightned by the Hopes of Victory, they quickly made themſelves Maſters of four other Towers, and there planted their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enſigns.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time they who fought upon the Key, and they who deſcended from the Gallies and Ships, where they were employed continually to ſhoot againſt the Curtain, inraged to think that they ſhould be the laſt in the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ran to the Gates, and with their Rams broak three of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; they alſo who were already gotten into the Town over the Walls, having opened the others which were between the Towers, which they had taken, the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64918:148"/>whole Army entred,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> and drew up in order between the Walls and the Heads of the Streets which abutted upon the Haven, that ſo they might not be ſurprized indiſorder, but be in a Condition regularly to attack any that ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to oppoſe them: For they ſaw the Emperor advantageouſly poſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them upon his Hill, and who had put his Troops in Battalia, before his Tents upon the riſing Grounds which lay on each Hand of him; ſo that he ſeemed either reſolved to charge the Confederate Army, to drive them again out of the City, or at leaſt, firmly to expect them in his advantageous Poſt, if they ſhould venture to attack him; and however to prevent them from proceeding further. But by the Cowardice of his men or poſſibly his own, and the fear he was in, to fall into the hands of the Princes, wanting the Reſolution of a Valiant man to conquer or to die nobly with his Sword in his Hand, he did neither the one nor the other; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> did no ſooner ſee the Knights in their glittering Armour mount their charging Horſes, with the Viſors of their Helmets down, and the Lance in the reſt begin to move, to run againſt them, having at the Head of them a brave Lord of great Stature, whom their fear made them magnifie into a Giant, but they inſtantly disbanded, and with all the haſt they could, began to run and ſave themſelves, ſome out of the City by the <hi>Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Gate, others in the Palace, and in the Churches which they Barricadoed to defend themſelves. The Emperor at full Speed threw himſelf into the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, which had one Gate upon the <hi>Propontis;</hi> and the greateſt part of the Lords and Officers, retrenched themſelves in that Quarter, and in the Palace of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querneſs.</hi> All the reſt, following that Example, ran in a dreadful diſorder through the Streets to gain their Houſes, the Victors ſtill being at their Heels, who in this firſt fury, which was not eaſie to be ſtopped in the taking of a City by Aſſault, overthrew and killed all that they could reach, making a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Slaughter among theſe miſerable People; and above all the <hi>Latins</hi> who had inhabited <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made the moſt cruel carnage to revenge themſelves, for having been baniſhed out of it upon the great Conflagration of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate City.</p>
                  <p>The Night, which now came on apace, favourably for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſtopped the Current of this Fury; a retreat was ſounded, and the Princes having rallied their men in an open Place, diſtributed them into three Quarters and ordered them to fortifie themſelves there, not doubting, but that they muſt have more fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work to gain the reſt of the City, and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> would not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves in ſo many advantageous Poſts, which they might very eaſily be able to defend; as in our time we have known the People of <hi>Naples</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> retrench one againſt the other, in divers Quarters of the Streets and in the Monaſteries, and to fight for ſeveral Months in one City, as if it had been a great Province, in which one is obliged to take ſeveral Cities and Forts, to make a Conqueſt of the whole. Thus the whole Army was poſted near the Towers and the Wall which they had taken, and which they were able to defend; the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> encamped cloſe by the Walls to be near his Ships, if any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhould in the Night be made againſt them. The Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> by a happy Preſage, lodged himſelf in the Imperial Tents, which <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> had leſt ready for him upon the Hill, where he was poſted during the Aſſault. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> his men lay upon his right, and retrenched themſelves before the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs;</hi> and Marquis <hi>Boniface</hi> took his Lodgement to the left in a quarter lying more to the Eaſt, where certain Soldiers, fearing to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſet ſire to ſome Houſes, that, as they thought, lay too near them, and ſo occaſioned a third ſire which reduced the greateſt part of that quarter of the City into Aſhes. As for the Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> he was not at the taking of the City being extremely ill that day with a ſit of a terrible Quartane Ague which kept him in his Bed, and hindred him from being at the Attack, which was no ſmall Affliction to him, who was as deſirous of being preſent there as he was ſtout and courageous, being eſteemed, as he really was, one of the moſt Brave and Valiant men of his time.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe Precautions of the Confederates were unneceſſary, for early the next morning being drawn up in Battalia, and expecting to be incountred with at leaſt a hundred thouſand Enemies, they were met with nothing but Proceſſions,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64918:148"/>which from all Quarters came before them, bearing the Croſſes,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> the Banners and Images of Saints to implore the Clemency of the Victors. For while the Princes were in this manner retrenching themſelves in their ſeveral Ports; <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> who had ordered all things ready for his concealed Deſign, iſſuing out of the Palace, ran about the Streets and the Market Places, animating the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to defend their Liberty againſt this Handful of Deſperado's, as he termed them, who had now ſhut themſelves into a Place from whence it was impoſſible for them to eſcape, provided they could find Courage enough to oppoſe them, and telling them it was the eaſieſt matter in the World to ſurround them, and take them alive and make them all Slaves; this he ſpoak with ſo much aſſurance, and proteſted that he would march at the head of thoſe who had the Courage to follow him to a moſt undoubted Victory, that a great many of the People and all the Soldiers, reſolved the next morning under his Conduct, to attack the <hi>French</hi> in their Quarters. But this Infamous Coward was ſo far from the Intention of executing what he pretended, that retiring to the great palace, as he ſaid, a little to repoſe himſelf, he followed the Example of his uſurping Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor old <hi>Alexis,</hi> and in the night made his eſcape upon a Ship which he had cauſed to be made ready for him. He took along with him the Empreſs <hi>Euphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine,</hi> Wife to <hi>Alexis,</hi> and her Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> of whom he was ſo deſperately Amorous, that he choſe rather to loſe his Honor and his Empire, than to expoſe himſelf to the Danger of miſſing the Satisfaction of his Paſſion, which, coſt what it would, he was reſolved to gratifie, as he did, by abandoning his Lawful Wife to eſpouſe that fooliſh Princeſs. So blind and Tyrannous, is irregular Love, in a Heart which yields it ſelf up to its Uſurpation, where, when once thoſe Groſs and Earthy Flames prevail, they extinguiſh all the Lights of Reaſon, and Vertue, and even thoſe more common Principles of good ſenſe and Nature.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as this Shameful Flight of <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> was known, the People ran thundring to the Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> to make a new Emperor, and in the Tumult <hi>Theodore Laſcaris,</hi> who was juſt returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was inſtantly choſen, and compelled to take the Helm of this Ship of the Government which was now agitated by ſuch a Furious Tempeſt. But in a few Moments after this new Prince perceiving that this Ardor of the People began to ſlag, and that inſtead of following him to oppoſe the Enemy, every man began to think of ſaving one, he alſo took the ſame Meaſures, and before day made his Eſcape in the beſt manner that he could. Upon this the whole City threw down their Arms and fell to their Prayers and Proceſſions, to implore the Mercy and Compaſſion of the Conquerors; addreſſing themſelves principally to the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was known among them, and to whom the flattering <hi>Greeks</hi> already gave the Title of Emperor, believing that he ought to be the man. Thus by the moſt aſtoniſhing and prodigious Event which hath nothing comparable to it in all Hiſtory, the greateſt City of the World, the richeſt and according to the manner of thoſe times, the beſt fortified, and defended by above four hundred thouſand men, was taken by Aſſault, and peaceably poſſeſſed by the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, whoſe Army did not conſiſt in above twenty thouſand Combatants. Which may inform the Chriſtians, <hi>That this very ſame City, which at this day is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſtrong, ſo well furniſhed, nor peopled, by far as it was then, and upon the taking whereof the Conqueſt of the Eaſtern Empire would moſt certainly depend, could never be able to reſiſt one of thoſe great Armies, which their Diviſions, ſo fatal to the Intereſt of Chriſtian Religion, oblige them ſo often to bring into the Field for their mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> But this is an Evil which for a long time we have deplored, and muſt ſtill lament, unleſs it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God, in whoſe hands are the Hearts of Princes, to give a firm and ſolid Peace among them, and inſpire the Heart of ſome generous <hi>Hero</hi> with Courage equal to this of theſe Brave <hi>French</hi> Princes, who with ſo few Forces accompliſhed this glorious Enterpriſe; which would not be ſo great an Impoſſibility even for their Deſcendants to undertake if they were in a Condition of Aſſurance from the Hatred, the Ambition and the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>The Princes pleaſingly ſurprized to find that they had nothing but Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, where they expected Enemies, immediately, with the Generoſity which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64918:149"/>always accompanies true Valour,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> promiſed them their Lives, their Honour, their Liberty, and one part of their Eſtates, which they knew by the Laws of War, all appertained to the Conquerors. They therefore commanded them to retire into their Houſes; and then gave the Soldiers the Plunder of the City for that day, but with ſtrict Command to ſhed no blood, and to preſerve the Honor of the Women, above all other things: they alſo commanded that all the Spoils ſhould be brought into Common Repoſitories, to the End that a juſt Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be made with Equality, according to the Merit and Quality of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon. This being done, the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat</hi> went to the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce of the Emperors, where were the two Empreſſes, <hi>Agnes</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Auguſt, the Widow of the two Emperors, <hi>Alexis</hi> the Son of <hi>Manuel,</hi> and <hi>Andronicus,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> the Widow of the Emperor <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and moſt of the Ladies of the firſt Quality who were retired thither. The Marquis treated them with all imaginable Honor and Civility due to their Character, and not long after married the Empreſs <hi>Margaret.</hi> At the ſame time Prince Henry ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſented himſelf before the Palace of <hi>Blaquerneſs,</hi> whither the greateſt part of the Nobility and men of Condition were retired, they rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him as Priſoners of War, their Lives only ſaved. There were found in theſe two Palaces moſt Ineſtimable Riches, which the two Princes cauſed to be moſt carefully guarded from Spoil and Imbezlement. As for the Soldiers, who diſperſed themſelves all over the City as they pleaſed, no man daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, the Hiſtorian <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who was preſent, affirms, that they committed all the moſt horrible Exceſſes that can be imagined, by all ſorts of Violence, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, Avarice, Luſt and Impiety, not ſparing ſo much as the Churches, the Shrines, the Images, the Reliques, the Holy Veſſels, the very Boxes where the conſecrated Hoſt was kept, nor the moſt Sacred Myſteries of Religion, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned them with a thouſand ſuch abominable Sacriledges, as the very thought of them is ſufficient to raiſe in devout Minds the greateſt Horror and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but on the contrary, thoſe of our Hiſtorians, who have with the greateſt Exactneſs given us the Relation of all the Circumſtances of the taking and plundring of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſay nothing at all of this diſorder, although they were more likely to know the Truth than <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who, during the firſt Tumult, together with the Patriarch, <hi>John Camaterus,</hi> ſaved himſelf with his Family at <hi>Selyvrea.</hi> They only aſſure us, that the Soldiers made there the greateſt Booty in Gold, Silver, Veſſels, Pearls, precious Stones, Cloth of Gold, Silks, Rich Furs, and in all ſorts of precious Moveables, that ever was made at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any City ſince the Creation of the World, as the Mareſhal <hi>de Ville Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douin</hi> after his manner ingeniouſly expreſſeth himſelf. But to ſpeak without Diſſimulation, I believe, after the matter is throughly conſidered, one may affirm that one of them ſays too much, and the other too little. For as to what concerns <hi>Nicetas,</hi> it is but reading this part of his Hiſtory, and one ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convinced, that the Exceſs of his Grief, and the hatred, which upon all Occaſions he makes appear againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> tranſported him beyond all Limits whatſoever, not only to ſpeak ſharply, but with a kind of Fury in Exaggerations, mingled with Invectives, injurious reproaches and moſt tragical Exclamations, which as they are inſupportable even in a Declamer upon a feigned Subject, who is paid for making Lies and Scurrilities, are intolerable, and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of an Hiſtorian, who ought not to be credited when he writes after ſuch a manner. As for our Writers who moſt aſſuredly were men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Honeſty, as it is below all men of Spirit and Courage, there is great Probability that they would not be guilty of ſo baſe a Vice as lying, and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the World with Falſities; though it is impoſſible they might think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpenſable, if they did not relate all the ill things, which were done, and which are impoſſible to be prevented in ſuch diſmal Events, as the taking of Cities by Aſſault. For as it is very likely that all the Soldiers, who were not Saints, though they were <hi>Cruſades,</hi> might commit diſorders, like to thoſe which in our time, we have known upon ſuch occaſions; ſo this is certain, that the report was too publick, not to be too true; for Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſome time after he writ to the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the General of the Army, although he at laſt approved of the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as a means

Be it how it will, this is moſt certain, that both the Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who before were poor, and at beſt, but in an indifferent Condition, as being reduced to an extreme Neceſſity of all things, became that day Rich, and in an inſtant exchanged their Wants, for a moſt prodigious Plenty of all things; for without accounting the Moveables, the Statues, the Pictures, and the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and a hundred other things of mighty Value, and that part of the Booty which moſt of them reſerved to themſelves, notwithſtanding all the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary, yet there remained to the <hi>French,</hi> after all their Debts to the <hi>Venetians</hi> were paid, and they too had half of the Spoil, above four hundred thouſand Marks in Silver, to be diſtributed among them; beſides that a fourth part of what was thus brought to the common Stock, was reſerved for him who ſhould be choſen Emperor. And nevertheleſs the <hi>Greeks</hi> had time enough during the Night after the Aſſault, to hide, as they did, the greateſt part of their Silver and beſt things, which they afterwards peaceably injoyed. Beſides the three dreadful Fires, muſt needs be ſuppoſed to have conſumed an infinite of Goods and Treaſure; and the Emperors, and moſt eminent Perſons of the Empire, who made their Eſcape both by Sea and Land, had carried with them whatever they had, that was moſt portable and precious. So that hereby one may judge of the Riches of this imperial City, which fell under the Power of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> without any other Loſs in the taking, than of one ſingle Knight, who in too eagerly purſuing the flying <hi>Greeks,</hi> fell into a Ditch which they had cut in the Street, and was ſlain by his Fall.</p>
                  <p>But in my Opinion, the beſt part of this great Booty, was the precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an infinite number of holy Relicks, which the Emperors, after great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had cauſed to be tranſported from the whole Eaſt, and eſpecially from <hi>Paleſtine</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and which ſince the taking thereof, have inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many famous Churches in <hi>Italy, Germany, Flanders,</hi> and all <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially <hi>France.</hi> For from thence came the greateſt part of thoſe which are in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church of St. <hi>Dennis, Philip</hi> the <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to whom the Emperor <hi>Baldwin</hi> ſent them, in Perſon receiving them, and tranſporting them thither, with a Pomp and Magnificence worthy of the Piety of ſo great a King: From thence we have the ſacred Crown of Thornes, the true Croſs, the top of the Spear with which our Saviour's precious Side was pierced, and the other holy Relicks, which are reverenced in the ſacred Chappel of <hi>Paris,</hi> where they were put by St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who by the Conſent of the Emperor <hi>Baldwin de Courtenai,</hi> his Kinſman, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out of the Hands of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to whom they were pawned. And that I may not trouble the Reader with a long Catalogue, thoſe which are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Churches of <hi>Soiſſons, Troyes, Beauvais, Langres, Chartres, Laon,</hi> and ſo many others, as appears by the Deeds of thoſe Churches, came all from hence; and from hence it was that the Church of <hi>Amiens</hi> had the Head of that Divine Precurſor of Chriſt Jeſus, St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, which renders it ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: Nor can the Truth of that precious Depoſitum be longer doubted, ſince that <hi>Monſieur Cange,</hi> in the excellent Treatiſe which he hath written about that Relick, hath ſo ſolidly Eſtabliſhed, and ſo cleared the Truth, by diſſipating all the Clouds which have been raiſed to obſcure it, that in my Opinion there are none but thoſe who are willfully Blind, but muſt ſee the Truth of it.</p>
                  <p>There remained nothing now to be done, but to create a new Emperor; and for this Purpoſe there had been twelve Electors named, ſo ſoon as the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was reſolved upon. There were ſix <hi>Venetians</hi> which were, the Admiral, <hi>Vitalis Dandolo, Otho Quirini, Bertaccio Contarini, Nicholas Navagieri, Pantaleon Barbo,</hi> and <hi>John Baſegio;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> alſo named as many on their Part, which were the Biſhops of <hi>Soiſſons, Troyes,</hi> and <hi>Halberſtad,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> whom the Pope had cauſed to paſs from <hi>Paleſtine</hi> to the Army, to be his Agent there, <hi>John</hi> Biſhop Elect of <hi>Acre,</hi> and the new Abbot of <hi>Los</hi> in <hi>Montſerrat.</hi> An Election of this Nature was without doubt a very tender Affair, in regard that there being many Pretenders to this extraordinary Honor, there was great reaſon to fear, that thoſe who were excluded by the Choice of their Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64918:150"/>ſhould abandon the new Emperor,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> and by leaving him almoſt alone, put him out of the Condition of maintaining himſelf in an Empire newly conquered, and wholly unſetled. Beſides, there was reaſon to apprehend that the Electors of the <hi>French</hi> would be mightily divided, by reaſon of the underhand Influence of the Pretenders upon them, and that conſequently the <hi>Venetians</hi> would indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably be the Maſters of the Election, who would all concur to place that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor upon the Perſon of the Doge, who, notwithſtanding the loſs of his Sight, was moſt capable of Governing a great Empire, as for a long time he had made it apparent by his moſt admirable Government of that flouriſhing Republick. Notwithſtanding all theſe Appearances to the contrary, by the marvellous Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Election was made in the moſt peacable manner in the World, and to the great Satisfaction of all Parties.</p>
                  <p>For theſe People being moſt wiſe and able Politicians, conſidered, that if they ſhould chuſe a <hi>Venetian</hi> for the Emperor, they ſhould run the Hazard of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing their Republick, which without doubt would be ſwallowed up in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the inſeparable Companion of the Empire; and beſides, they ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were not in a Condition long to maintain this Empire without the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> and that alſo a new Emperor would be obliged mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to depend of them, it being impoſſible for him long to ſubſiſt without their Maritim Succors. Hereupon they had no further Thoughts of placing one of their own Nation upon the imperial Throne, but turned their Indeavours and Aims wholly to the Point of making all the Advantage they could of this new Conqueſt, for the Increaſe of their Republick: On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> did themſelves all the Juſtice imaginable, and were unanimous in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Election ought to fall either upon the Marquis <hi>Boniface,</hi> who was their General, or upon Count <hi>Baldwin,</hi> in regard, that without Diſpute theſe two Princes were the moſt potent of all the Confederates, and conſequently, moſt capable of maintaining and defending the new Empire. Whereupon to avoid all manner of Diſputes and Differences, which might happen betwixt them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Election, it was by their Conſent agreed, that whichſoever of them two ſhould be Choſen, ſhould beſtow upon the other, to be held in fee of the Empire, all thoſe Territories which formerly belonged to the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, on the other ſide the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> together with the Iſle of <hi>Candia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being done, the twelve Electors being aſſembled in the Chappel of the great Imperial Palace, called <hi>Bucoleon,</hi> to proceed to the Election, the ſix <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> nominated <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> herein following the Counſel of their Doge, with whom they had before conferred about it. That wiſe Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he tenderly loved this young Prince, who uſed to treat the old Doge with that Reſpect, as if he had been his Father, believed alſo that he was the moſt proper Perſon to hold the Empire, as well by reaſon that he was in the prime of his Age, as of his Power, wherein he did aſſuredly much ſurpaſs the Marquis, both in the extent of his Dominions, number of Men, and in Eſtate; he alſo, by a profound Policy, wiſely conſidered, that it was much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the good of the Republick, to chuſe a Prince, whoſe Dominions lay remote from thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> as did <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hainault,</hi> whereas the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who was their near Neighbor, and a great Soldier, might prove a terrible Enemy, in caſe of any Breach between them, and being ſtrengthened with the Forces of ſo great an Empire, might be in a Condition to do them much Damage both by Sea and Land. For theſe Reaſons, the ſix <hi>Venetians,</hi> without any Heſitation, named <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for the Emperor, and thoſe who were of his Party among the <hi>French,</hi> at the ſame time joyning with them in the Choice; the others, who were for the Marquis, perceiving that it was but loſt Labor to give their Votes for him, and that it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to manifeſt an unprofitable Imprudence to oppoſe them, they alſo cloſed with them, and declared themſelves for Prince <hi>Baldwin;</hi> ſo that by common Conſent of the twelve Electors, <hi>Baldwin</hi> Prince of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hainault,</hi> was ſolemnly proclaimed Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and in eight days after he was ſolemnly Crowned in the Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> with all the magnificent Ceremonies which were uſed to be obſerved at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of the Emperors, and with the Applauſe and general Acclamations of the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Greeks.</hi>

He was then in the one and thirthieth Year of his Age; of a tall Stature, a Shape extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Majeſtick, and of a noble Mind; the Turn of his Face, and all the Lineaments of it were moſt agreeable, his Hair fair, his Eyes ſweet, and a graceful Smile continually ſate about his Mouth, the Air of his Face was naturally Modeſt, but it was ſuch as did not in the leaſt diminiſh that Fire and Vivacity which upon Occaſion appeared in it. He had a very ſtrong Conſtitution, and a Health, which had been ſo well managed with Temperance, the beſt Phyſician, that it was Proof againſt all the Fatigues of War, and all the Inconveniences of Life, which he pleaſantly Supported, without loſing any thing of his Vigor, either of Body or Mind: His Soul ſeemed naturally to partake of all the Vertues and Perfections of Mind, for he was, as even <hi>Nicetas</hi> himſelf is conſtrained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, of a rare Piety towards God, and of admirable Charity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his Subjects, eſpecially towards the Poor and Miſerable, for whoſe Comfort and Relief he ſpared nothing; he was a paſſionate Lover of Juſtice, which he did indifferently diſtribute to all Perſons; he was Free and Sincere, eaſy in his Converſation, willingly hearing what was the Opinion of thoſe who took the Liberty to differ from his Sentiments; plain and mighty Moderate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own Perſon, tho wonderful Magnificent in all other things; Liberal and Bountiful to all except himſelf: and that which infinitely heightned all theſe admirable Qualities, he was ſo Chaſt, that he never beſtowed any amorous Glances upon any other Woman beſides the Empreſs, his Wife; nor would he ſuffer any Lewdneſs or Debauchery among his Domeſticks, or permit ſuch as were convicted to have in any manner violated the Laws of Chaſtity, to remain in his Court. This is the true Pourtraict of the Emperor <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who was the firſt of the <hi>Latins</hi> who held the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which had been ſo gloriouſly Conquered by the <hi>Cruſades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which he did, that ſo he might inviolably keep and obſerve what was decreed before this Election, was to cauſe one of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks to be choſen Patriarch; this was <hi>Thomas Moreſini,</hi> whoſe Election, tho at firſt it was declared null and contrary to the Canons by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> yet at the Inſtance of the Emperor, he did anew create him Patriarch; and then it was that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was re-united with the <hi>Latin,</hi> by the Obedience which it rendred to the Pope, as Head of the Univerſal Church, from which it had been ſo long ſeparated by Schiſm and Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>After this, there was a Diviſion and Diſtribution made of the Lands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Empire: The Marquis <hi>Boniface</hi> exchanged the Provinces which he was to have had in <hi>Aſia,</hi> for the new Kingdom of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which he deſired, that ſo he might be nearer his Brother-in-Law, the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> had the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> with many Cities upon the Coaſts of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> together with the Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi> which they purchaſed of the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to whom it had been given by the young <hi>Alexis. Bithynia,</hi> under the Title of a Dutchy, fell to the Share of the Count <hi>de Blois; William de Champlite</hi> of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> had the Principality of <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> which he Conquered, and at his Death left to <hi>Geoffry de Ville Hardouin,</hi> Nephew to the Mareſhal of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> who had alſo for his Share the Province of <hi>Romania.</hi> There were alſo ſeveral other Principalities, Lands, and great Cities, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> conferred upon the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the Army. After this, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror taking the Field, before the Winter, reduced all the Cities of <hi>Thracia</hi> under his Obeyſance; and to compleat his good Fortune, the old <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the perſidious <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> who ſtill carried themſelves as Emperors in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, fell alive into his victorious Hands, and received Juſtice according to their Demerits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> after his Flight, was retired into a City of <hi>Thracia,</hi> about four days March from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and having rallied ſome Troops, he, with them, ſeized upon <hi>Tzurulum,</hi> at this day called <hi>Chiorli,</hi> between the imperial City and <hi>Adrianople;</hi> But when he perceived that all Places ſurrendred themſelves to

Murt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuphle</hi> ſent to him, to offer him his Troops and his Service againſt the common Enemy, and intreated him to do him the Honor, to conſider him, and receive him as his Son-in-Law, who could have no other Intereſts but his. But <hi>Alexis,</hi> whether it were that he hated him becauſe he was more wicked than himſelf, or that he diſtruſted him, or that he was reſolved to revenge the Affront and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that had been done by him to his Daughter, or poſſibly, that wholly Miſerable as he was himſelf, yet he could not indure that another ſhould call himſelf Emperor, he reſolved to deſtroy him, and to puniſh his Perfidy by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaſon. For as the Devils in the other World are the Executioners of God's Decrees upon the Damned; ſo the Crimes of wicked Men in this Life, ſerve his Juſtice, in the puniſhing of thoſe Offences which other wicked Men have committed. This diſſembling and treacherous old Man, therefore made ſhew of receiving theſe Offers of his Son-in-Law, with all the Marks of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affection which he could have wiſhed; he went in Perſon to Confer with him, they imbraced, they kiſſed, and reciprocally gave to each other their Faith, proteſting that they would hereafter never have any other but the ſame Intereſt and the ſame Heart. After which <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> made no difficulty intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to truſt his Father-in-Law, and went confidently to an Entertainment, to which he was invited by him; but as he was conducted into a Chamber, where the Trap was ſet for him, the People of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who were in Readineſs for that Purpoſe, fell upon him, and overthrowing him, they immediately pulled his Eyes out of his Head. Thus divine Juſtice, the wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, ordered it, that one Tyrant ſhould execute upon another, the ſame Cruelty which he himſelf had, about nine Years before, adviſed him to act upon his own Brother, the Emperor <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after, <hi>Alexis</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Baldwin,</hi> to whom all <hi>Thracia</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, was coming againſt him, he fled into <hi>Macedon</hi> with ſo much Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſorder, that ſome of the Friends of <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> all whoſe Troops were disbanded, found the Means to procure his Eſcape: But after he had for ſome time wandred in Diſguiſe with a ſmall Attendance, intending to paſs the Strait of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to ſave himſelf in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was ſurprized by <hi>Thierri de Los,</hi> who had got notice of him, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Emperor would have him proceeded againſt in due courſe of Law. He was therefore accuſed before the Princes of an infinite number of Crimes, and above all, of being guilty of the moſt deteſtable Parricide upon the Perſon of the young Emperor <hi>Alexis,</hi> who he had ſtrangled with his own Hands. The Fact was publickly notorious, nor could he deny it; but yet he had the audacious Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to indeavour to juſtify himſelf, by maintaining that he had done nothing but what was moſt Juſt, and what was approved by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and even the Relations of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who had loſt his Right to the Empire, and deſerved Death for having betraied his Country in ſelling it to Strangers. But as his inſolent Anſwers, were ſo far from diminiſhing his Crime, that they rendred him more O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, ſo he was condemned to a Death, which might ſtrike a Terror into all thoſe who were the Accomplices or Approvers of his Parricide. For this Purpoſe he was led into the great Square, called that of the <hi>Bull,</hi> in the middle of which, the great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had erected a marble Column of extraordinary Height, which being hollow, had a Staircaſe within, by which they might go to the Top, upon which that Emperor had cauſed his Statue in Braſs, upon Horſeback, to be placed; but that happening to be thrown down by an Earthquake in the Reign of <hi>Zeno, Anaſtatius</hi> his Succeſſor, cauſed his to be ſet up in the Room of it, and that having alſo the ſame Fate, there was nothing after ſet up, but it remained as a little Lodge, which was inhabited by a new Stylite, who by the means of that Retreat injoyed a Solitude in the midſt of the greateſt and moſt populous City in the World. It was to the Top of this high Column that the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Murtzuphle</hi> was carried, and in the view of the whole City, which might eaſily ſee it from all parts, this Square of the <hi>Bull</hi> being one of the moſt eminent
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64918:151"/>of the ſeven. Hills upon which <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtands,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> he was thrown down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and daſhed in pieces. Juſt it was, that he ſhould thus die by this fearful manner of Death, that from thence Poſterity may learn, that if Ambition ſometimes mounts wicked Men to the Eminency of Fortune, by Treaſons, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, Murders, Parricides, and all manner of Crimes, which ſhe never ſpares to prompt her Followers to, when ſhe judges them for her Purpoſe. Yet does ſhe at the laſt bring them, when at the top of this Height, to the moſt horrible Precipice, from whence their Fall is ſo much the more Fatal, by how much they fall from the greater Height.</p>
                  <p>That which is moſt ſtrange in this terrible Execution, is, that among other Figures which were carved round about this Column, there was to be ſeen that of an Emperor thrown down in that very manner from a Column, which the People took for a Prophetick Mark of the Deſtiny of this miſerable Prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to an ancient Oracle, which ran currant by Tradition among them at <hi>Conſtantinople, That the Ox ſhould bellow, and the Bull ſhould weep.</hi> It is true, that the Combats and the Victories of the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> were repreſented upon this Column, as are to be ſeen at this day at <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> upon the two famous Columns there, which bear their Names; and thus it is poſſible, that among thoſe Figures there may be the Repreſentation of ſome barbarous Prince falling headlong from a high Tower, which they took for a Prediction of this Emperor's Deſtiny; but that there ſhould be any real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, either in this Figure, or in the Story of the Bull's weeping, to forebode the Death of <hi>Murtzuphle,</hi> is what I cannot eaſily believe. For in ſhort, theſe ſort of Prophecys, of which there are numerous Examples, are ſo obſcure, that they either ſignify nothing at all, or all that one would have them ſignify; and that commonly they are taken in a Senſe far different, from that, wherein by the Event they explain themſelves. Witneſs that Prediction which they had, and upon which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſo much relied, that the <hi>Latins</hi> ſhould never take <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by Force, becauſe the Prophecy told them that the City ſhould never be taken but by an Angel. But the fooliſh <hi>Greeks</hi> were mightily miſtaken in their Interpretation, as the Event ſhewed, there being the Picture of an Angel in the very place where the City was forced. And this ought to teach <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not to amuſe themſelves with theſe Predictions, which are not at all authoriſed by the Holy Scripture, or the Church; and ordinarily thoſe over curious Perſons, in their own Sottiſhneſs and Credulity find their own Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Event deceiving them, by proving contrary to their Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which are cheated by the Ambiguous Riddles, ſuch as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Oracles of the <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the tragical End of one of the Tyrants; as for the other, the old <hi>Alexis,</hi> it is true indeed, that his was not altogether ſo ſad, but altogether as unhappy. For having for ſome time followed <hi>Leon Scurus,</hi> one of his Sons-in-Law, who pretended to oppoſe the Progreſs of Marquis <hi>Boniface</hi> in <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> when he ſaw that all things ſtooped under the Arms of this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince, he deſpaired of being able to ſave himſelf; to prevent his being taken therefore he voluntarily yeilded himſelf and the Empreſs <hi>Euphroſine,</hi> with the imperial Ornaments, to the Marquis, who inſtantly ſent them to the Emperor. After which, the poor <hi>Alexis</hi> only deſiring wherewith to paſs the reſt of his miſerable Age in ſome ſort of Repoſe, there were ſome Lands aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him for that purpoſe, but it being found out that he fell to his old trade of ſecret Caballing, the Marquis, to take from him the means of doing Miſchief, ſince he could not cure him of the Will to do it, ſent him Priſoner to <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:</hi> Some ſay that he found Means to eſcape from thence, and to paſs over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia,</hi> to his other Son-in-Law <hi>Laſcaris,</hi> who had ſeized upon <hi>Nice,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom, this perfidious Dotard ſtirred up the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo that he was forced to take him and clap him into a Monaſtery, where he had time to finiſh his Life in Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about nine hundred Years after its Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment under the great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was tranſlated from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> by the ſtrangeſt and moſt memorable Conqueſt that ever was made by ſo ſmall a Force, and in ſo little a time, being undertaken and accompliſhed in one

But it hath been an old Obſervation, that Lions, with a timerous Stagg for their Captain, will all prove Harts, and that even fearful Deer, when led by a Lion, will do like Lions. But in ſhort, there was not one of thoſe who ſeparated from the Army of the Confederates, to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> who had not ſufficient Reaſon of Repentance, either for the Diſgrace, or the Damage which he ſuffered. Even <hi>Simon de Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> who before this had done ſo many Wonders in the War againſt the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> was forced to return into <hi>France,</hi> without bringing home with him from the Voyage, any thing except the Trouble to have done nothing. So dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to quit the main Body to which one is related, and from which no better Fortune is to be expected, but like a Branch cut from the Stem of a Tree, to be blaſted and withered.</p>
                  <p>In this miſerable Eſtate were the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Eaſt, and almoſt reduced to the utmoſt Diſpair, when they received the News of the taking of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> by the Confederate Princes, of whom, even thoſe, who had abandoned them, were conſtrained to demand Help from thoſe to whom they had before denied theirs, tho it was not to be expected, that ſo ſmall a Number, ingaged in ſo great an Enterpriſe, as the ſettling of their new Conqueſts, and inlarging them, could, for the preſent, be able to afford them. It is impoſſible however to expreſs the Joy which this News gave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> who now, did not queſtion in the leaſt, but the Way was opened for the moſt ſhort and certain Deliverance of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> from the Oppreſſion of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Infidels.</hi> But in regard of the Fear they were in of loſing all, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Misfortunes, as one upon the Neck of another had fallen upon them, King <hi>Emeri</hi> had before made a moſt diſadvantageous Truce with the <hi>Infidels,</hi> for ſix Years; whereupon all the <hi>Cruſades</hi> who were in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> went to wait upon the new Emperor at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Legate himſelf, <hi>Peter de Capua,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> being ſent for thither by <hi>Baldwin,</hi> to regulate the Affairs of the Church, ſailed thither, and was followed by his Collegue, the Cardinal of St. <hi>Praxede,</hi> and ſuch a multitude of the Oriental <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of all Conditions, that the King was, almoſt, left quite alone, without any Forces conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to oppoſe the <hi>Infidels,</hi> if they ſhould attempt to break the Truce, as they quickly after did.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was hereupon mightily afraid, and extremely troubled, that his Legats ſhould alſo without his Order, abandon the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God averted this threatned Miſfortune, by a War, which preſently broke out among the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> one againſt another; and the Pope comforted himſelf with the Conqueſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was altogether ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to him. He now no longer condemned this Enterpriſe of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> as he had done formerly, the fortunate Succeſs thereof fully juſtifying the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64918:154"/>And beſides,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1204</label> he now was convinced, that nothing could have been done more profitable and advantageous, either for the Glory of God, in the Good of the univerſal Church; or, in particular, for the Deliverance of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> And for this purpoſe, that ſuch a Conqueſt might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whereupon that of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> depended, he writ his Circular Letters to all the Archbiſhops of <hi>France,</hi> and their Suffragans, by which he exhorted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to perſuade the <hi>French</hi> to take Arms, and march to the Aſſiſtance of their Brethren at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And, above all, he deſired that they would ſend ſome zealous, learned Men, furniſhed with Books, to labour in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt had taken ſuch care of, that it might flouriſh in all manner of Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was then in high Reputation throughout the World; and this wiſe Pope, who had himſelf been ſometimes a Member of that great Body, writ to them upon this Subject with ſo much force, that many Doctors and Batchellors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by his Reaſons, and inflamed with a Zeal truly Apoſtolical, went to propagate the Light of Truth, and the Orthodox Doctrine in the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which had been obſcured by many Errours of the Schiſm. Thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which, with infinite Wiſdom, takes care of all things, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Matters, that, upon this Occaſion, it ſeemed to make a Retalliation, by ordering that <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould render the ſame Service to <hi>Greece,</hi> which <hi>Greece</hi> had ſometime beſtowed upon <hi>France,</hi> by ſending thither St. <hi>Denis,</hi> to be an Apoſtle for that Country. The Pope alſo, at that time, did not fail to write to the victorious Army, which had ſo gloriouſly executed that marvellous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, to oblige them to ſtay another Year in that Empire, to aſſure thoſe Conqueſts, provided that, by the <hi>Infidels</hi> breaking of the Truce, there was not an abſolute neceſſity that they ſhould ſpeedily repair to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to ſuccour the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there, againſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilſt the Pope laboured with ſo much diligence for the Good of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> in the Eaſt, there happened in the <hi>Holy Land</hi> two deplorable Accidents, which very much diſturbed the Joy of that happy Succeſs of the Arms of the Confederates. The firſt was, the Death of the Counteſs <hi>Mary,</hi> Siſter of the deceaſed Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> Niece to <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and Wife to <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who had ſo generouſly taken up the Croſs with her Husband, reſolving to run the ſame Fortunes with him; but being big with Child, ſhe was not at that time in a Condition to go along with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after ſhe had lain in, ſhe imbarked upon the Fleet which was commanded by <hi>John de Nele.</hi> She had not been long at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where ſhe landed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of her Husband, Count <hi>Baldwin,</hi> before ſhe received the News, that, after the Taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he was elevated to the Imperial Throne. The Joy which this News occaſioned, made ſuch a violent Impreſſion upon her Body, extreamly infeebled with the Fatigues of ſo long a Voyage, that not being able to ſurmount it, ſhe died of the two Exceſſes of Joy and Weakneſs. So that the Ships which were ſent by the Emperor, to conduct her with Pomp to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to receive the Crown Imperial with her deareſt Husband, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her Body only thither, to be, as it was, with the moſt magnificent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, uſual upon ſuch ſad Occaſions, interred in the Church of <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1205</label> This ſad Accident was preſently ſucceeded by another, which brought a great Change in the Affairs of the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For King <hi>Emeri de Luſignan</hi> dying in the City of <hi>Acre,</hi> and the little <hi>Emeri,</hi> his Son, not long ſurviving him, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> his Mother, the Wife of <hi>Emeri,</hi> at the ſame time alſo following them to the Tomb, the Crown, by Right of Succeſſion, deſcended to the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> her eldeſt Daughter, who was uſually called the Marchioneſs, becauſe ſhe was born to her of the famous Marquis <hi>de Montferrat,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> her ſecond Husband. Hereupon the Eſtates being aſſembled, to provide a Husband for the young Queen, who might be able to act and govern the Realm, in a time wherein there was ſuch need of a King of great Abilities, to ſupply the defect of Forces which remained in the Realm, after ſo many Diſaſters: But the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and Ambition of ſo many Great Men of the ſame Realm, not permitting them to agree in an Election of one of their own number, they being all Rivals,

<label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>There was, no queſtion, ſomething very ſurprizing and unaccountable in the Conduct of <hi>Philip</hi> in this Encounter; for there were in <hi>France</hi> many great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of very high Quality, upon whom he might have caſt his Eyes; yet, nevertheleſs, whether their illuſtrious Merit, his own particular Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome unknown politick Reaſons governed him in his Choice, two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times ſucceſſively, he choſe, it is true, out of a very Noble Houſe, though ſomething inferiour in Quality to many others, two Brothers, whom upon two Occaſions he preferred in the Diſpoſal of two Crowns: They were <hi>Gautier</hi> II.

But after ſo many Victories, as he beſieged their General <hi>Diepold</hi> in a certain Caſtle to which he had driven him, the Contempt which he had of his Enemies was the occaſion of his falling into their Hands; for in the Night the General ſurprized him in his Tent, and carried him Priſoner to the Caſtle, all covered in Blood, where he ſhortly after died, more of Grief than of his Wounds; ſo much nearer than their Swords had done did the Trouble and Affliction go to his heart, to ſee himſelf in the power of thoſe whom he had ſo deſpiſed; complaining that he had ſo ill guarded himſelf againſt the Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Germans,</hi> who, he ſaid, by Day-light, though in compleat Armour, durſt not venture to attack the <hi>French</hi> ſtark naked, and unarmed. Thus, by his Preſumption, he loſt that in a Moment, which, by his Valour and great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he had acquired by abundance of gallant Actions, which he had performed in four Years before.</p>
                  <p>As for his Brother, <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> who, among all the great Lords of <hi>France,</hi> was choſen by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, to marry the young Queen of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> he received that Honour with all the marks of a profound Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and promiſed the Ambaſſadors, before their Parting, that he would, with all the Forces he could raiſe, come for <hi>Paleſtine</hi> before the Expiration of the Truce.

And for the other Letters which the Pope writ to all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People, they came to nothing at laſt, but to raiſe thoſe great Diſorders which had happened in the former <hi>Cruſades:</hi> For it happened by a ſtrange Illuſion, or rather, a kind of Frenſy, which, like a Plague, ſpread it ſelf over all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the Youths of all ſorts of Conditions, taking a ſtrong Impreſſion in their Minds that God would make uſe of their Hands, to deliver the Holy Sepulchre out of the Hands of the <hi>Saraſins;</hi> and that he commanded them to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve that high Enterpriſe, they aſſembled to the number of thirty thouſand in <hi>France,</hi> and twenty thouſand in <hi>Germany,</hi> who took upon them the Croſs. There were many Monks and Prieſts, who undertook to juſtifie this Folly by another which was greater; and, as if God had commanded it, put themſelves at the Head of theſe Boys, and other Vagabonds, who maliciouſly followed them, to make ſome advantage of this Diſorder; and it being impoſſible to ſtop the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of this furious Folly, they pleaſantly marched along, ſinging and crying all together, with all their power, <hi>Lord Jeſus, beſtow upon us thy Holy Croſs.</hi> The greateſt part of thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> taking diſſerent Roads, either periſhed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably on the Way, or were diſpoiled by Thieves and Robbers.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that God, who alone can bring Good out of Evil, for his Glory, drew this Advantage from this great Diſorder, and horrible Treachery, that divers of theſe Innocents, whom the <hi>Infidels</hi> endeavoured to force to deny and renounce their Faith, perſiſted ſo conſtantly to confeſs Jeſus Chriſt, for whoſe ſake they had taken the Croſs, that they choſe rather to be cut in pieces, than to renounce their Faith; and by this irregular and frantick Action, came at laſt to obtain the Crown of Martyrdom. At laſt, the memorable Victory which <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt obtained againſt <hi>Otho,</hi> who, having been crowned after the Death of the Emperor <hi>Philip,</hi> troubled all <hi>Europe,</hi> gave the Pope the occaſion to accompliſh, by the General Council, the great Deſign of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which he had begun by his Letters, and which the Preachers, by his Orders, publiſhed every where.</p>
                  <p>This Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> made a moſt cruel War againſt the Pope, who had always been his Protector, ſo that he was, at laſt, conſtrained, by his extream Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to excommunicate him; as alſo, for his openly invading the Churches Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſeizing upon what the Holy See had received from the magnificent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of the Kings of <hi>France. Philip</hi> the Auguſt, who, beſides that he hated <hi>Otho,</hi> as being the Nephew of his Enemy, the King of <hi>England,</hi> thought himſelf obliged to maintain what his Predeceſſors had done in favour of the Holy See, ſailed not to declare himſelf for the Pope; and negotiated ſo powerfully with divers Princes of the Empire, the principal whereof were the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Archbiſhops of <hi>Treves, Mayence</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> that they depoſed this ingrateful, excommunicate Prince, and elected <hi>Frederick,</hi> whom his Father, the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> VI. had cauſed to be declared King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> at the Age of three Years, and who was alſo King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> in Right of the Empreſs <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> his Mother.

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the twelfth Oecumenical Council, and the fourth of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and one of the greateſt which the Church had ever had; for, beſides the Pope, who preſided in Perſon, the Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of thoſe of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> were preſent at it, together with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty one Archbiſhops, four hundred and twelve Biſhops, with the Proxies of divers others, above eight hundred Abbots and Priors, and the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England, France, Hungary, Jeruſalem, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Aragon.</hi> The Pope, who was a Man very learned and eloquent, opened the Seſſion by a Speech which is <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> inſerted into the Acts of the Council, as he ſpoke it; and therein, after he had acquainted them, that the principal Reaſon why he had aſſembled them, was to conſider how they might relieve the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he brought in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> addreſſing her ſelf to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Weſt, and to implore their Aſſiſtance, in the Language of the holy Scripture; repreſenting, in a manner ſo pathetick and moving, the piteous Eſtate to which ſhe was reduced under the Tyrannick Dominion of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> to the ſhame of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but the whole Aſſembly ſhould be moved with it, or refuſe taking the generous Reſolution of employing all things for the Deliverance of the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from that cruel Servitude.

That they themſelves ſhould exhort the Kings, the Princes, and Perſons of the greateſt Quality, to take upon them the Croſs, and to contribute to the Expences of the Holy War. That the Biſhops, the Abbots, the Priors, and all other Eccleſiaſticks, ſhould give the twentieth part of their Revenues, and the Pope and Cardinals the tenth, towards the carrying on the</hi> Cruſade. <hi>And to excite others, by his Example, to this Liberality, the Pope promiſed, that, beſides this Tax, he would provide Shipping, and great Sums of Money for the particular Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ſuch of the</hi> Romans <hi>as ſhould take upon them the Croſs. That the</hi> Cruſades <hi>ſhould have all the ſame Privileges, Spiritual and Temporal, which the former Popes had indulged to the firſt</hi> Cruſades. <hi>That they ſhould all be in readineſs to paſs into</hi> Paleſtine <hi>by the</hi> 1ſt <hi>Day of</hi> June, <hi>in the following Year. That, in the Interim, thoſe who reſolved to be of the Land-Army ſhould come to the Rendezvouz which ſhould be appointed, whither the Pope would ſend his Legate; and that thoſe who choſe rather to go by Sea, ſhould repair to the Port of</hi> Brindes <hi>in</hi> Pavia, <hi>or to</hi> Meſſina <hi>in</hi> Sicily, <hi>where he himſelf would be preſent, to take care, and give Orders, for what ſhould be needful, ſince he was not, as he paſſionately deſired, permitted to paſs beyond the Seas, and take the Voyage with the</hi> Cruſades. <hi>That there ſhould be either a Peace, or a Truce among the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes for four Years; and that, during that time, all publick Sports and Turnaments ſhould be ſtraitly prohibited. That thoſe who aided the</hi> Cruſades, <hi>or furniſhed them with Equipage, ſhould enjoy the Benefits of the Indulgences. And, on the contrary, that ſuch as favoured the Pyrates, and ſuch</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Merchants as betrayed their Brethren, by ſelling Arms and Ammunition to the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>ſhould, as impious Traytors to God and Religion, be expoſed to all the Cenſures of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be avowed that our Anceſtors, who acted as exactly and prudently, but with far fewer Intrigues of Nicity and Ceremony than we do at this Day, were far more expeditious in the concluding of their greateſt Affairs, than in the ſucceeding Ages. This great Council, wherein ſo many, and ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Matters were debated, both in relation to Faith and Manners, ſo many things of a differing Nature, as the Policy and the Diſcipline of the Church, the Peace among the <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, and the War againſt the <hi>Inſidels,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the general Intereſts of all <hi>Europe,</hi> was terminated in leſs than three Weeks, continuing only between the Feaſt of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Andrew:</hi> a time which now would ſcarcely be thought ſufficient for the regulating of one ſingle Preliminary Article in an Aſſembly of far leſs importance than this was: And that which is ſtill more admirable, the Execution immediately ſucceeded the Debates and Determinations, no manner of Conſiderations, Paſſions or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts being capable of ſtopping, or even ſo much as retarding it; every one glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributing what was his part, towards the Performance and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Deſign. The Biſhops preached the <hi>Cruſade</hi> in all places,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1216</label> with mighty Zeal, and great Succeſs; and the Pope, to give the greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to it, after he had publiſhed it in <hi>Rome,</hi> went to preach it himſelf in <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where there was an inſinite of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> every one deſiring to have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to receive the Croſs from his own Hands.</p>
                  <p>But as he was going to <hi>Piſa,</hi> to accord the Differences between that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the other of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which did ſomething hinder the Effect of the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade,</hi> in his Paſſage by <hi>Peruſa,</hi> he was ſeized with a violent Fever, occaſioned by his great Pains, and the exceſſive Heats of the Seaſon, which, in a few days, carried him out of the World. He died the 6th Day of <hi>July,</hi> in the 19th Year of his Pontificate, and the 49th of his Life, after having performed all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Soveraign Pope, in ſuch perfection, that there have been few of his Succeſſors, I do not ſay, that have ſurpaſſed him, but that have been equal to him; and if we may give Credit to the unanimous Conſent of all the Authors that write of him, none greater, either in Learning, in Prudence, in Firmneſs of Reſolution, in Authority, over all the Powers of the Earth, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Diſcipline of the Church in its Force and Vigour; or any more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Purity of the Faith, or more converſant than himſelf in all manner of vertuous Actions, which, as they are the Effects, ſo they are, upon Earth, the moſt certain Marks of a moſt eminent Sanctity. And from hence, doubtleſs,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64918:157"/>we may conclude,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1216</label> that there is nothing more Unjuſt or more Weak, than the giving Credit to the Fable of the Apparition of this Pope being purſued by a Dragon after his Death, which demanded Juſtice of God againſt him; till at laſt covered all over in ſlames, he was condemned to Purgatory till the day of Judgment, for having commited three great Crimes in his Life, for which he had certainly been condemned to Hell for ever, if our Lady, to whoſe Honor he had built a Church, had not obtained the Grace for him, that he repented of them before his lateſt Breath. Now this which calls it ſelf an Apparition, ſo plainly reſembles the travelling Stories of Apparitions of this Nature, that I am aſtoniſhed there ſhould be any who ſhould doubt of its Falſhood, ſo much as for a Moment; but it is the ſordid Humor of low Spirits, to diſhonor the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of the greateſt Lives in the World, whom they durſt ſcarcely ſpeak of or look upon whileſt they were in it; and nothing is more frequent than for Calumny to blaſt the Reputation of the Dead, by reaſon of that Impunity which Men hope for by being undiſcovered; nor is there any thing ſo ſilly, but what will either by the Weakneſs of ſome, or the Malice of others, be believed; ſo that the moſt ſottiſh and groundleſs Illuſions, come many times to gain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as well as the Name of ſupernatural Viſions and Revelations.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal <hi>Cencius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> of the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Savelli,</hi> a Perſon of a great Eſtate, and as great Learning, ſucceeded <hi>Innocent</hi> within two days, by the Name of <hi>Honorius</hi> the III, and imitating his Predeceſſor in his Zeal for the Deliverance of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he at the ſame time writ Letters to the Princes and Prelates throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> exhorting them powerfully not to cool in their Zeal, which they had till then manifeſted for the Execution of what had been Decreed in the Holy Council, in reſerence to the <hi>Cruſade.</hi> And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe Letters, and the Negotiations of his Legats which he ſent to all places, to preſs the Accompliſhment of this great Affair, which lay ſo near his Heart, and which he followed ſo cloſely with his utmoſt Application and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, was ſo ſucceſsful, that an infinite number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Northern Nations, were ready to paſs both by Sea and Land into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> at the time appointed. He who ought to have Headed them, was the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the II. who had with the firſt taken upon him the Croſs, then when he ſtood in need of the Aſſiſtance of the late Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> for his Eſtabliſhment againſt <hi>Otho,</hi> in the imperial Dignity. He took it upon him with more Solemnity, the year after the Battle of <hi>Bovine,</hi> when all things being at Peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> he was by the Authority of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> the ſecond time crowned at <hi>Aix,</hi> by the Hands of <hi>Siffride</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayence:</hi> There he renewed his Vow, and with a great deal of Reverence and Submiſſion, received the Decree of the Council for the <hi>Cruſade.</hi> But as he had a ſpecious Pretext to deſer his Voyage, in regard he had not been at <hi>Rome</hi> to receive the imperial Crown, nor to regulate the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope thought it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient at that time to preſs him further with the Accompliſhment of his Vow.</p>

The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> was therefore the only Prince of <hi>Europe,</hi> who in Perſon made that Holy Voyage, and the principal Princes and Prelates who accompanied him in the Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were the Dukes of <hi>Auſtria, Bavaria, Moravia, Brabant, Limbourg,</hi> the Counts <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> of <hi>Los,</hi> of <hi>Juliers,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Wida,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Baden,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Bamberge, Paſſau, Strasbourg, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> arrived firſt at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> about the Feaſt of the Nativity of our Lady, and thoſe who imbarked at the Ports of <hi>Brindes, Meſſina,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> coming up within a few days, he parted from thence, accompanied with <hi>Hugh de Luſignan,</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> who had taken upon them the Croſs, and all together came happily to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Acre.</hi> After the Army had for ſome time refreſhed themſelves about the City, where the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> by an ill Beginning, and an unlucky Preſage of this War, committed fearful Diſorders upon the Lands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom they treated moſt inhumanely. King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> joyned himſelf with the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with thoſe few Troops which he had, accompanied with the Knights of the Temple, the Hoſpital, and the Teutonick Order. And the Truce which had been made with the <hi>Saraſins</hi> being expired, they went and incamped in a convenient Place, near the Brook <hi>Kiſon,</hi> there to take a general Review of their Troops, and then to march directly to find out <hi>Coradin,</hi> who had already paſſed the River <hi>Jordan</hi> with a powerful Army, and made a ſhew, as if he would give the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Battle. The Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe Reſidence was now in the City of <hi>Acre,</hi> believing that upon this Occaſion he ought to imitate his Predeceſſors, who were uſed to carry the ſacred Croſs in their Wars, before the Kings, therefore in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> being followed by all the Clergy in Proceſſion, went to the Camp carrying a part of that ſacred Wood which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had preſerved. For <hi>James de Vitri,</hi> who was afterwards a Cardinal, and who before had been Curate of <hi>Argentucil</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> and then of <hi>Ogniez</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Liege,</hi> where he was made Canon Regular, and at this time was Biſhop of <hi>Acre,</hi> and accompanied the Kings in this War, aſſures us that he had heard it of ſome antient People in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> that before the Battle of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> where they fought ſo unfortunately againſt <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:64918:158"/>they being according to cuſtom,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1217</label> to carry the Croſs before King <hi>Guy de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan,</hi> he was adviſed, by a certain Preſage of the future Loſs, to cauſe the ſacred Wood to be cut, and one part of it to be kept, that ſuch a precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in caſe it ſhould be taken in the Battle, as it happened, might not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Approach of the Patriarch, the Kings and Princes came out of the Camp, and walked barefooted to meet him, to receive that ſacred Pledge, the Inſtrument whereupon our Salvation was wrought, with a marvellous Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perfect Confidence in Jeſus Chriſt, who, they hoped, would in that Sign give them Power to overcome all the Enemies of his holy Name, as he had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it overcome all the Enemies of our Salvation. The next Morning, the Army being drawn up in Battalia, paſſed the Torrent, marching Eaſtward towards the great Valley of <hi>Eſdrelon,</hi> anciently called <hi>Megiddo,</hi> now called the Plain of <hi>Faba,</hi> and that Day advanced as far as the Fountain of <hi>Tubany,</hi> in old time called <hi>Jeſreel,</hi> near the City of that Name. There the Couriers, who were ſent to diſcover the Enemy, brought word that they had ſeen great Clouds of Duſt, ſo that it was believed <hi>Coradin</hi> was advancing to give them Battle. That was then the thing which the Army moſt deſired, ſo that very early the next Morning, the Army marched to meet the Enemy, and entred into the great Valley of <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> having the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa</hi> on the right Hand, and the Mount <hi>Hermon</hi> upon the left, with a great Moraſs at the Foot of it. This was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Poſt, where they might advantageouſly make the Field of Battle; but no Enemy appearing, they advanced as far as <hi>Bethſhan,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Sythopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> a great City, lying in a Plain very convenient for the giving Battle, between the Mountain of <hi>Gilboa</hi> and the River <hi>Jordan. Coradin</hi> had been there, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the Plain, boaſting that there he would fight the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army; but when he underſtood that the Kings were there in Perſon, and that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ſtronger than his, he durſt not tempt Fortune by a deciſive Blow; and therefore following the Orders and the Example of his Father <hi>Saphadin,</hi> who kept himſelf at <hi>Babylon,</hi> expecting till the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould have weakned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he was already retired beyond the River the Day before, which was the Occaſion of the Duſt which the Scouts had diſcovered, and thought he had been therefore approaching to meet the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But it was the quite contrary, for he was then retreating, leaving the Country to the Kings, who after they had, with the whole Army, with great Devotion, waſhed themſelves in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and coaſted along the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> or the great Lake of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſareth,</hi> to viſit the Places conſecrated by the Preſence and the Miracles of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, they returned about the end of the Month to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> with a very rich Booty, and abundance of Priſoners, which they had taken in the Country of the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> But this not being what was expected from ſo great an Army, and there appearing no Enemy to combat with in the Field, they reſolved to beſiege the Fortreſs which <hi>Coradin</hi> had built upon the top of Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which did extremely inconvenience the City of <hi>Acre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Tabor,</hi> which is ſo famous in both the old and new Teſtament, is one of the faireſt and moſt pleaſant Mountains of the World: It raiſeth its lofty Head in the middle of a fair Plain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> about ſome thirty Furlongs in height, which is near a League and half of our Meaſure, ſo that like a Pharus or watch Tower, it may be ſeen at a great Diſtance by thoſe who ſail upon the Sea, and alſo from the top of this Mountain one may diſcover a great part of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> eſpecially all the Champion of <hi>Galilee,</hi> the main Ocean, the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and the Courſe of the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> All this Proſpect lay ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly round about it, that Nature ſeemed to have pleaſed herſelf in forming this pleaſant round Circle, from the Baſe whereof Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> raiſeth it ſelf by ſmall Degrees, leſſening the new Circles with an equal Roundneſs to the very Top, which by reaſon of its Height looks like a mighty Pyramid to thoſe who are at the Bottom of it. It is on all ſides very ſteep, and on the North ſide wholly inacceſſible, and there is no coming up to it on the other ſides, but by very ſtrait and difficult Paſſages. And tho it be thus ſteep and high, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving continually the moſt pure Due of Heaven, which falls ſweetly from its Top, and expands it ſelf downwards, it is cloathed particularly towards the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64918:158"/>Weſt and South, with abundance of Trees which are continually Green,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1217</label> load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with pleaſant Fruits, and where the Birds, who inhabit in theſe agreeable Thickets, ſill the Air with their melodious Songs; the Earth, which at the Foot of theſe Trees, is by their Shade protected from the ſcorching Heats, is ever green, being enamelled with many Plants, and beautiful Flowers, which Nature there, without the help of Art produceth in abundance, and which by the infinite ſweetneſs of their mixed Odors, perfume and embalm the Air which one draws in, upon that delightful ſpot of Ground.</p>
                  <p>From the Foot of this Mountain riſeth the famous Brook of <hi>Kiſon,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having for a while ſlowed Southward, divides it ſelf into two Rivolets near the City of <hi>Endor,</hi> about the Place where <hi>Barak</hi> deſcending from Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> overthrew the mighty Hoſt of <hi>Siſera.</hi> The leſſer of theſe Rivulets, rowls gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Eaſt, all along by the famous Hill of <hi>Hermon,</hi> receiving the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Springs, which fall from thence in abundance, and at laſt loſeth it ſelf in the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> near the City of <hi>Bethſhan;</hi> the greater of theſe two Brooks takes a quite contrary Courſe towards the Weſt, along by the Mountain of <hi>Son,</hi> and the little City <hi>Naim,</hi> and after having traverſed the greateſt part of the Vally of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> and growing proud with the Tribute of ſeveral little Torrents which deſcending from Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſwell its Streams, at laſt it diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Phenician</hi> Sea, about a Mile from <hi>Caiphas,</hi> at the Foot of Mount <hi>Carmel.</hi> There was formerly a Fortreſs upon the top of this Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as he himſelf tells us, cauſed in forty days to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by a Wall, thereby to defend himſelf againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding took it, and demoliſhed it. The Empreſs <hi>Helena,</hi> a long time after that built a fair and magnificent Church there, in the place where the Son of God was transfigured before the three Diſciples; and that there might be there three Tabernacles, according to the Wiſh of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> there were alſo two fair Monaſteries, conſecrated to the Memory of thoſe two great Prophets, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who had the honor to participate of the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiguration. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had always preſerved theſe ſacred Places, as well as divers others in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> even during the Domination of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saraſins,</hi> to whom they payed Tribute for their Poſſeſſing of them. But <hi>Saladin,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Tiberias</hi> becoming Maſter of them, cauſed them to be demoliſhed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the remaining Fortifications; and <hi>Coradin</hi> his Nephew becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter of the Field after the Retreat of thoſe few Troops which King <hi>John de Brienne</hi> had brought with him, at his Arrival in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> built there a ſtrong Fortreſs, environed with ſeventy ſeven Towers, and put into it a ſtrong Garriſon, who by their continual Excurſions, laid waſt all the Country for ſeven or eight Leagues around Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> even to the very Gates of <hi>Ptolemais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princes therefore being reſolved to attack that Place, they marched the Army thither about the beginning of <hi>December;</hi> they preſently found the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſo Difficult, that it was thought the Enterpriſe was next to impoſſible. But the Patriarch who carried the Croſs, which he ſhewed to the whole Army, marched at the Head of them with ſo much Reſolution, followed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Clergy, ſinging of Hymns, that the Princes, the Officers and Soldiers were aſhamed to ſtay behind: But, above all, the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who animated all the reſt by his Example, having, at laſt, gained the Top of the Mountain before the reſt, charged ſo furiouſly upon thoſe who were ſallied out of the Fortreſs, to defend the Avenues, that, after having ſlain the two Captains who commanded them, he forced them to turn their Backs, and make more haſte into the Fortreſs, to ſave themſelves, than they had done to come out of it, to repulſe him; and ſo terrified were they by his prodigious Valour, that they abandoned thoſe Poſts, which they might eaſily have maintained againſt him, only by rowling down great Stones upon ſuch as ſhould attempt to mount the Hill.</p>
                  <p>But this Valour ſignified nothing by reaſon of the Obſtinacy, the Jealouſie, and, it may be, the Treachery of <hi>Bohemond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tripolis;</hi> for a Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held, in what manner they ſhould attack the place, he maintained ſtiffly, that this Siege could by no means be undertaken, without manifeſtly expoſing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64918:159"/>themſelves to the danger of being beſieged by the Army of <hi>Coradin,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1217</label> who, by ſeiſing the Foot of the Mountain, might ſtarve them to death; or, if they ſhould oppoſe him with a part of their Army, might eaſily cut them in pieces. It was remonſtrated to him, on the contrary, that they ſhould certainly carry the place before <hi>Coradin</hi> could come up to relieve it. But ſtill he perſiſted ſo pertinaciouſly in his Opinion, and found himſelf backed by ſuch a ſtrong Party, whom he had gained, that, at length, his Advice was taken, and by one of the moſt unaccountable Adventures which ever was ſeen in War, the ſame day that they had, by main force, with their Swords in their Hands, gained the Top of the Mountain, in order to attack the Fortreſs, as they might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully have done, they coldly deſcended from thence without doing any thing, as if they had fought for nothing elſe but to get upon the Top of Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> to walk, and take the Air, and look about them from that delightful Proſpect. The Enemies, whom they had beaten in mounting the Hill, now alſo took Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and when they ſaw this unexpected Retreat, took occaſion to return their Viſit, and beat their Vanquiſhers down the Hill again, killing many valiant Men with their Darts and Arrows as they deſcended with difficulty down thoſe ſtrait and troubleſom Paſſages. This ſo enraged the Patriarch, that he would no longer march with the Croſs at the Head of an Army, whom ſuch a ſacred Sign could not animate with more Courage. After this alſo, the Kings under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to make a third Irruption into the Countries of the <hi>Infidels</hi> in <hi>Phenicia,</hi> received there a new Diſgrace, and a greater Loſs than before, both by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Seaſon, which was ſo extream cold that many of their Soldiers were benummed and frozen to death by the way, and by the continual Ambuſhes which the wild <hi>Arabian</hi> Robbers laid for them in all the Paſſes: But, above all, upon <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve,</hi> they were ſurprized in the plain Field, between <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sarepta,</hi> by ſuch a fearful Tempeſt of Wind, Rain, Hail, Whirl-blaſts, mingled with moſt terrible Thunder and Lightning, that they had all like to have been there loſt.</p>
                  <p>After theſe unhappy Accidents, the Army, which could not ſubſiſt in ſuch narrow Quarters as were in and about <hi>Acre,</hi> was divided into four Bodies, which ſeparated in ſuch a manner, that it was eaſie to foreſee they would never meet together again: For thoſe who were diſguſted at the Proceedings of the War, which were the greateſt number, remained at <hi>Acre,</hi> expecting the Convenience of returning into <hi>Europe.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> The King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the great Maſter of the <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> with the greateſt part of the Biſhops, went and encamped about <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> where they cauſed the Citadel which formerly joyned to that great City, and which had been demoliſhed, to be re-built with ſo much Expedition and Diligence, that they had wholly finiſhed it before the Army of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> could draw together to interrupt them in the Work. The great Maſters of the <hi>Temple</hi> and the Teutonick Order, with a ſmall number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Gautier d' Aveſnes,</hi> remained between the City of <hi>Acre</hi> and <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and there fortified an old Caſtle of the Pilgrims, upon a Promontory which advanceth it ſelf into the Sea, near Mount <hi>Carmel;</hi> and in the clearing of the Ruins, found a Treaſure which defrayed the Charges they were at in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of it.

                  <p>This Loſs of the Aſſiſtance of two ſuch conſiderable Kings, accompanied with ſo many brave Men, was quickly after repaired by another Re-inforcement, which came very ſeaſonably to begin the next Campaigne; for almoſt at the ſame time that King <hi>John de Brienne, Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the three great Maſters of the Military Orders, after they had ſiniſhed the Fortreſſes of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> and the <hi>Pilgrims Caſtle,</hi> were come to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> to deliberate upon what was to be done in the poſture wherein their Affairs then ſtood, they were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſurprized to ſee the greateſt part of the Northern Fleet arrive, for they had utterly deſpaired of it, there having not been the leaſt Account what was become of it ſince the time that it firſt put to Sea.</p>
                  <p>This great Fleet had weighed from the Mouth of the <hi>Maſe,</hi> the 29th Day of <hi>May,</hi> and had happily paſſed the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but they were a long time ſtayed, by contrary Winds, upon the Coaſt of <hi>Spain;</hi> and after they had been bruiſed by a furious Tempeſt, in which they loſt ſeveral Ships, upon the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the reſt of the Fleet, which had been ſeparated by the Storm, had been, with great difficulty, at laſt met together about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> in the River of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> Now as the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Wida,</hi> who were gotten up to the Port of this great City, had given Order to re-ſit their Ships, the Biſhops of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>d' Evora,</hi> the great Priors of the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital,</hi> and the Commander of the Order of the Knights of St. <hi>James</hi> of the Sword, or <hi>Palmela,</hi> and many great Lords of the Realm, came to wait upon them from <hi>Alphonſus</hi> II.

That before their Fleet could be repaired ſo as to be put into a Condition of going to Sea, the Seaſon for Navigation would be paſt: And that if they ſhould reſolutely purſue their Voyage, yet would it be ineffectual, in regard that, before they could arrive at</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>it would be far advanced in the Year; that they muſt paſs the Winter there unprofuably. That therefore it would be more advantageous and glorious for them to paſs it in</hi> Portugal, <hi>and lend them their Aſſiſtance to take</hi> Alcazar <hi>from the</hi> Saraſins, <hi>which they conjured them to do by the Zeal which they had to Religion; aſſuring them, that this Enterpriſe, of which they would give an Account to the Pope, would be moſt pleaſing to him; and that thereby they ſhould merit the Recompence of a</hi> Cruſade.</p>
                  <p>The Earls having propoſed this Affair to the Council of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> there were many that oppoſed it; proteſting that they would immediately go to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Vow. The <hi>Friſons,</hi> above all, appeared moſt determined in this Reſolution; and the Matter went ſo far that they ſeparated from the Earls, and parted with the firſt fair Wind, the twenty ſixth of <hi>July,</hi> with above eighty Ships, who were followed by ſome others of ſeveral Nations, and tho the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome time proved favourable to them, they were conſtrained to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Corneta,</hi> at <hi>Gaieta,</hi> and ſeveral other Ports of <hi>Italy.</hi> But the Earls, who after that Separation, and thoſe which had been loſt during the Tempeſt, had not above a hundred Ships, believed that they could not more profitably ſerve <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> than upon this Occaſion, reſolved to undertake the Siege of <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> which accordingly therefore they undertook with the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Month of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> They firſt attempted to ſtorm the Place, but that Attempt not Succeeding, in regard that the Garriſon, which was very ſtrong, defended themſelves with abundance of Vigor, they found themſelves obliged to beſiege it according to the regular Way, by Sapping and Mining; this they followed without making any great Progreſs, till the ninth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> at which time a great Succor of four <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> appeared within a League of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army. The Battle was not long deferred, for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64918:160"/>the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> wonderfully encouraged by the Arrival of the Troops of the Templers, who, the Night before the Battle joyned the Army; and much more by the Sight of the glorious Standard of the Croſs, which appeared in the Air, as it were, to give them, not only the Signal of the Combat, but an aſſured ſign of Victory and Triumph, went courageouſly againſt the Enemy, although their numbers were incomparably greater than theirs.</p>
                  <p>The Battle began early in the Morning, the eleventh Day of <hi>September,</hi> with an incredible Heat on both Sides; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> truſting in the Aid of Heaven, which the Croſs they had ſeen, ſeemed to promiſe them; and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> in their Multitude; and beſides being ranged in Battalia towards the Eaſt, they had the Sun upon their Backs, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> full in their Eyes. Thus the Combat was very obſtinate on both ſides, Victory continuing in Suſpence for a long time to which ſide ſhe would incline; till at laſt, the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> ſtruck with a pannick Fear, as if new Enemies had fallen upon them, began to ſtagger and recoil, and in a ſhort time to throw down their Arms, and betake themſelves to Flight, with all the Haſt the deſire of Safety could lend them.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that in the heat of the Battle, there appeared new Squadrons of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeers in white Armor, who advanced at the Head of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Saraſins</hi> with an infinite Storm of Darts and Lances, and that the brightneſs of their glittering Arms and Shields ſo dazled the <hi>Infidels,</hi> that they were not able to indure the ſhining Beams, or the furious Shock they gave them, but that they inſtantly threw away their Arms and fled. However it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is moſt certain that their whole Army was intirely defeated, and that there remained above fourteen thouſand <hi>Saraſins</hi> dead upon the Place, with two of their Kings; that they purſued the Fugitives for three Leagues, gleaning up abundance of Straglers, who all fell by the Daughter of the Sword. They loſt all their Tents and Baggage, together with a number of Priſoners, who all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired who thoſe white Horſemen were, who with the Luſtre of their Bucklers had ſo blinded them, and put them into Diſorder. And it is ſaid that Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> ſeemed by one of his Letters to give credit to this miraculous Event. For my own particular, as I do not pretend to give all theſe ſorts of Apparitions for Truths, which I find in ſome credulous Authors, which is a great though too frequent Weakneſs; So I think myſelf obliged to take care not to ſuppreſs ſuch as have any probability of Eſtabliſhment upon Truth, and are related by ſuch credible Authors, to whom a Man of Senſe and Prudence may give ſome Faith.</p>
                  <p>After this great Victory, the <hi>Cruſades</hi> returned to the Siege of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> which defended it ſelf ſtill for a Month longer; but at laſt it was conſtrained to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon Deſcretion, upon the one and twentieth Day of <hi>October.</hi> There were made above two thouſand Slaves of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> which remained in the Garriſon, and the Place was put into the Hands of the Knights of <hi>Palmela,</hi> to whom it belonged, the great Maſter of which Order had ſignaliſed his Courage in an extraordinary manner, both in the Battle and the Siege. They alſo gave Liberty to the <hi>Saraſin</hi> Governor of the Place, and a hundred of his Officers, and ſeveral of his Soldiers, who with him received holy Baptiſm, and renounced the Superſtition of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The Pope, to whom the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſent the Relation of this great Succeſs, cauſed publick Thanks to be given to God in all Places, exhorting all faithful <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to imitate this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Example, and to take Arms to fight againſt the <hi>Saraſins</hi> who Poſſeſſed the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But he would never conſent that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> who had gained this important Victory, ſhould thereby be diſpenſed with from their Vow, as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> deſired, that ſo theſe brave Men might finiſh what they had ſo happily begun in <hi>Spain,</hi> by chaſing the <hi>Moors</hi> from thence. For this Reaſon therefore <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> General of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who had aſſured the Pope that he would inviolably obſerve his Orders, after he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Winter at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſet Sail in the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> Having paſſed the Straits of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> he was ſurprized by a Tempeſt, which laſted for three days, which ſo diſperſed his Fleet, that without being able to unite again, ſome of them were forced into <hi>Barcelona,</hi> others into <hi>Marſeilles, Genoa, Piſa,</hi> and <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> from whence they continued their Voyage to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one after another.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Reſolution being taken, all the Fleet rendezvouzed at the <hi>Pilgrims Caſtle,</hi> from whence the <hi>Friſons</hi> and <hi>Cologners,</hi> who were the firſt that were in readineſs, having choſen the Count <hi>de Sarpont</hi> to command them, ſet Sail, and with the favour of a Stern-Wind, which blew a luſty Gale from the Northward, they came in three Days, upon the 30th of <hi>May,</hi> before <hi>Damiata,</hi> and, by a lucky beginning of the War, made their Deſcent without Reſiſtance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themſelves before the City, expecting the coming up of the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Damiata</hi> was, at that time, one of the faireſt and richeſt Cities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and, without diſpute, the ſtrongeſt, as being the Key of the Kingdom, ſituate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Nile,</hi> about a Mile from one of its Mouths. This great River, whoſe Spring was for ſo long time unknown, is now diſcovered to riſe from five or ſix Fountains at the Foot of the Mountains of the Moon, in thirteen or fourteen Degrees of Southern Latitude, and ſo to croſs the great Lake of <hi>Zembr;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having wandred from the South to the North, quite through the vaſt Tracts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and the higher <hi>Egypt,</hi> it divides it ſelf below <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> or <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> ſome twenty Leagues from the Sea, into two Arms; one of which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Right Hand, towards the Eaſt, and the other to the Left, towards the Weſt, form that great Triangle, which is the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which, by reaſon of its Triangular Figure, the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Delta.</hi> Theſe two Arms divide themſelves again into others, which, diſcharging themſelves into the Sea, make thoſe Mouths of the <hi>Nile,</hi> whoſe number is very uncertain; moſt Authors make them ſeven, ſome nine, and others will have it that there are eleven; but <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who had moſt exactly ſearched the number of them upon the place, aſſures us that there are no more than four: All which Differences may be eaſily reconciled, by conſidering that when this River overflows the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as it doth every Year, about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> till towards the midſt of <hi>September,</hi> it then diſchargeth it ſelf by other Chanals, which remain dry all the reſt of the Year; and that then it is reſtrained to thoſe four, which are the natural Branches, by which its Waters flow regularly, and without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Sea. The greateſt of the Weſtern Chanals is called the <hi>Peleuſiaque,</hi> from the name of the City <hi>Peluſium,</hi> which ſince is called <hi>Belbeis</hi> upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> towards the Coaſt of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> This City is uſually confounded with <hi>Damaita,</hi> by a Miſtake which certainly cannot be defended; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who ſpeaks exactly of theſe two Cities which he had ſeen, and which were beſieged by <hi>Amauri</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith poſitively, that the King, who had by Force, taken <hi>Peluſium,</hi> anciently called <hi>Belbeis,</hi> which, it is well known, ſtood upon the firſt Branch of the <hi>Nile,</hi> towards the Eaſt, paſſed the firſt Arm of the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64918:161"/>River,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> and marched at two Encampments, which is about twenty Miles, to beſiege <hi>Damiata</hi> upon the Oriental Coaſt of the ſecond Branch of the <hi>Nile,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile from the Sea.</p>
                  <p>This City was invironed with a double brick Wall, towards the <hi>Nile,</hi> and a trible one on that ſide toward the Land, the ſecond was higher than the firſt, and the third than the ſecond, with an infinite number of Towers to defend them, and a great Ditch, by which there is a Paſſage into the <hi>Nile,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes it round about, and makes it a great Iſland ſomething longer than it is broad. But that which it wants in Breadth is ſupplied by the fair Suburbs, which in Beauty and Riches, yield not to the City. And it being thither that all the Merchandiſes which come from <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the Red Sea, were brought, to be from thence tranſported into <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans had cauſed to be built upon the other ſide the River a very ſtrong Tower, capable of containing three hundred Soldiers to defend it, from whence there was drawn a huge Chain, to one of the Towers of the City, ſo that there was no comming in, or going out of the Harbor without the Permiſſion of the Sultan, who drew from them what Tribute he pleaſed, for the Exportation of all the Merchandiſes and Spiceries which were not to be had, but from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the reſt of the Army, which was for ſome time ſtayed by contrary Winds, was come up, the Soldiers being marvellouſly animated by an Eclipſe of the Moon, which they took for a certain Preſage of Victory, and the Ruine of the Sultan, a Reſolution was taken to attack the Tower upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> in regard that without that it was impoſſible to batter the City on the River ſide, which was the thing in deſign, that being the weakeſt part. For this purpoſe the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cauſed the great Ladders, in form of Draw-Bridges, to be faſtned to their Maſts, ſuch as had been made uſe of to be let down with Pullies, at the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Friſons,</hi> under the Conduct of Count <hi>Adolphus du Mont,</hi> made a kind of a Fort upon a great Ship, which below the Round Top of the Main Maſt, was like a little Caſtle, from whence they might commodiouſly ſhoot againſt thoſe who defended the Tower; and the Templers raiſed upon one of the ableſt of the Ships another Machin in form of a Cavalier, to batter the Enemy at the ſame time from another Quarter; but theſe Engines had not the happy Succeſs which they had promiſed from them; the main Maſt which ſupported the Bridge of the Knights of St. <hi>John,</hi> breaking in the middle, in the Fall drew along with it the Bridge; that alſo of the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was overturned and broaken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Feet of the Soldiers, who thronged upon it, and puſhed one another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with Precipitation, every one ſtriving to be foremoſt to ſight with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins,</hi> who expected them upon the top of the Tower. So that theſe valiant Men who marched with ſo much Heat, with their Swords in their Hands, againſt the Enemy, falling with their Bucklers and Swords one upon another, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Cordage, tumbled one upon another, and wounded themſelves ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their own Arms, before they fell from the Bridge into the River, where they were miſerably plunged in the deep Waters, and being armed, and ſuch a number of Men, Planks, and great pieces of broaken Timber that hindred their Swiming, they could not poſſibly ſave themſelves. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, which ſaw this lamentable Accident, without being able to remedy it, was infinitely troubled at it; but the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who, from the Towers and Walls ſaw this agreeable Spectacle, ſent forth Shouts of Joy, mingled with horrible Noiſes, Inſultings and Blaſphemies, which were ſo far from diſcouraging the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they were thereby animated more than before, to revenge theſe horrible Affronts &amp; Impieties.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon therefore, after they had drawn off the other two Machins of the <hi>Templers</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> which were for no purpoſe but to favor the other two which were ruined, it was reſolved, that the Gallies and lighter Ships ſhould paſs by the Chanal of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which was between the Tower and the other Bank, that ſo they might make themſelves Maſters of the higher part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and break the Bridge of Boats which made the Communication between the Town and the Tower of the <hi>Nile.</hi> This Deſign was as happily Executed as could be wiſhed; for in deſpight of the horrible ſtorm of Darts, Arrows, and Stones, which were poured upon them from the great Tower to defend the Paſſage,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64918:161"/>which the Beſieged did not believe they would be ſo mad as to attempt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> the Ships paſſed up the River; and lay ſo that no Ship could come down to relieve the Town: then they fell upon thoſe who defended the Bridge with ſo much Fury, that they broak it in divers places; ſo that the Tower could now no longer be ſuccoured from the City. In the mean time a very able Engineer invented a new ſort of Machin, which at laſt had that Effect which they had in vain expected from the others. This Man was called Maſter <hi>Olivier,</hi> who had been the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the Church of <hi>Cologne,</hi> a moſt famous Preacher, and who, after he had preached the <hi>Cruſade</hi> by the Pope's Order, in <hi>Germany, Frieſeland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> reſolved alſo to go along with them, and afterwards came to be Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derborn,</hi> and Cardinal by the Title of St. <hi>Sabine.</hi> It is to him that we are obliged for the Relation of this Siege, beginning after the taking of the Tower of the <hi>Nile,</hi> in which, by his Invention he had ſo great a Share, but withal ſo much Modeſty, as not to make any the leaſt mention of it.</p>
                  <p>This Perſon then, who was a man of a great Soul, and mightily beloved, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Soldiers which came from <hi>Cologne,</hi> with whom he took up the Croſs, cauſed this new Machin to be made with the Charity-money which he had collected for the <hi>Cruſade.</hi> He cauſed two great Ships to be tied together with ſtrong Cables and Hawſers, and that they might be the ſtronger, he cauſed ſtrong Piles of Timber, which joyned the Ships together at the Heads and Sterns, to be faſtned with ſtrong Claſps and Bolts of Iron; and all along between the two Ships were laid ſtrong Planks from the Hatches of one Ship to the other, upon which the Men might paſs conveniently; and theſe alſo were ſtrongly faſtned to the Ship at each End, which kept them cloſe from moving one from another. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two Ships, thus joyned firmly together, four of the ſtrongeſt Maſts that could be found were planted and joyned together in a Square by four of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Yards, which were faſtned to the Maſts almoſt at the top; upon theſe Yards there lay Joyſts faſtned, and over them Planks nailed down in the manner of a Platform; upon this was erected a wooden Caſtle, higher than the Tower of the <hi>Nile;</hi> and this Caſtle was covered with raw Hides of Oxen and Camels, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the Enemie's Fire; below this Caſtle, upon the Platform, was faſtned a great Ladder covered with Planks in form of a Draw-bridge, which hung by Pullies ready to be let down upon the Walls of the Tower, and this was ſo long that it extended ſeveral Yards over the Heads of the Ships; below this Machin there were placed certain long Tables, very thick and ſtrong, which were ſo faſtned to the Prows, that by the help of Ropes they might be heaved out to the Walls of the Tower, and ſerved as Bridges for the Miners, who might be at Work below in Sapping, whileſt the other attacked them above. This Work being finiſhed, and approved by the Captains, who found it was a moſt proper and rational Invention for the Execution of ſuch a difficult Deſign, they reſolved to make uſe of it, and to make their utmoſt Effort to carry the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And the better to diſpoſe and animate the Soldiers, and to obtain the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God for the Army, the Patriarch, Biſhops, and all the Clergy, followed by the King, Princes, and Officers, went barefoot in Proceſſion to the place where the Croſs was kept, which according to cuſtom was carried to this War. After which, <hi>Friday,</hi> the Feaſt of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> was appointed for the Day to begin the Aſſault; and choice was made for that Service, of Officers and Soldiers of all the Nations, who were to be Conducted by the brave <hi>Leopold,</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and this was done to avoid Jealouſies, and that they might all be Sharers in the Glory of ſo great an Action.</p>
                  <p>The Day, which with ſo much impatience was expected, being come, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was made in this manner. A great Ship well armed, ſailed up the <hi>Nile,</hi> which was mightily ſwelled, and went as it were to ſhew the Way to the great Machin which followed it filled on all Sides, below, upon the Platform, and the Caſtle with thoſe Valiant Men, upon whom the Eyes of the whole Army were faſtned, as the dear Pawns of their Honor, and the Fortune of the reſt. Theſe proud of the glorious Choice which had been made of them to ſuſtain ſuch an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enterpriſe, looked upon the Danger, and the Tower with a generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and a certain fierce and menacing Joy, which ſhewed the Reſolution they had taken, either to Periſh or to Conquer; ſtanding in the View of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64918:162"/>City,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> and the Army upon the Machin, as upon the Theatre of their Glory. The Clergy marched bare-footed in Proceſſion upon the Bank at the Right Hand of the Aſſailants, ſinging of Pſalms, and imploring the Aid of the God of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in favour of his Champions, againſt the Enemies of his holy Name: And the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who were run all to their Towers and their Ramparts, anſwered theſe Songs of Piety with fearful Howlings, and horrible Blaſphemies; at the ſame time diſcharging from their Stone-Bows and Slings a dreadful Shower of Stones, to break or ſtop this Machin, which, croſſing this furious Tempeſt, ſailed directly to the North ſide of the Tower, which lies to Seaward, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, by reaſon of the ſcantneſs of the Water, to get theſe heavy Ships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Weſtern Chanal, between the Tower and the Bank that lies againſt the Town. All the which Army was placed, partly upon the Decks of the Ships as they lay at Anchor, and partly drawn up upon the riſing Grounds, neareſt the Enemy, ſtood there to encourage the Aſſailants, and to be Spectators and Witneſſes of the brave Actions which were to be performed in a Combat of ſo extraordinary a nature.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Anchors were dropt on all ſides of the great Machin to keep it immovable in the diſtance, which was neceſſary for the lower Bridges and the great Ladder which hung upon the Platform, to reach to the Walls of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thoſe who were in the Wooden Caſtle, gave a moſt furious diſcharge of Darts, and Arrows, from that high place downward upon the Enemies, who defended the Tower; at the ſame time ſome faſtned the Bridges to the Walls, whileſt others threw themſelves upon them with a moſt Heroick Courage and without thinking of the Dangers, which threatned them in ſuch different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſome marched to the foot of the Tower to endeavour a Breach with the Force of Pick-Axes and other Inſtruments, whileſt thoſe above ran with their Swords in their hands, directly againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who defended the Walls, whileſt at the ſame time all the Engines of the City played upon the Aſſailants, and threw their Wild-fire by the long brazen Conduits, from the Tower againſt the Caſtle, the Platform and the Bridges, which began every where to take ſire; but there being great Proviſion made of Sand and Vinegar, the Infallible Cure of this evil, otherwiſe irremediable, it was ſoon extinguiſhed in all places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the end of the Draw-Bridge Ladder, which had like to have occaſioned the loſs of all in a Moment. For the Soldiers running violently to put out the fire, the Bridge had like to have been quite overthown by the Crowd, that was upon it; inſomuch that by its leaning all upon one ſide, he who carried the Banner of the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was overthrown into the Nile, and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> who were about him, as he fell from the end of the Bridge, ſnatched the Colours from him. Thereupon the <hi>Barbarians</hi> gave a mighty Shout, as it were to celebrate their Victory, which they now held moſt certain. The Patriarch, who lay proſtrate before the Croſs and the Clergy, round about it, ſent forth a greater to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Succour of Heaven, and the Army, which was upon the Hills, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Fall, fell upon the Ground, humbling themſelves before God, and joyning their Tears and Prayers to thoſe of the Patriarch and the Biſhops, they made all reſound with their piteous Cries, which pierced the Heavens from which they deſired Mercy and Help.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it long before, ſo many fervent Prayers obtained it, the fire was preſently extinguiſhed, the Bridge which hung all upon one ſide, was ſet right and ſixed, and the Aſſailants, without giving the Enemy the Leiſure to make a new Attempt upon the Machin, preſſed up to the Walls, and puſhing forward with their Bucklers in one hand, and charging with the Scimiter in the other, they loaded the <hi>Saraſins</hi> with ſuch heavy Blows, with thoſe, and the Battle Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Iron Maces, and pierced them with the Points of the half Pikes and Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, ſo that they forced them to recoil; then a brave <hi>Liegeois,</hi> who was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced foremoſt, immediately leaped into the Tower, and was at the ſame time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a young <hi>Frieſlander,</hi> who throwing himſelf into the middle of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> with a flail, the ſwipple of which was tied to the handle by little Chains, and which he handled in ſuch an admirable manner; that whisking it round about with mighty Force, Swiftneſs, and without ceaſing, he ſo thraſhed the <hi>Infidels</hi> breaking Skulls and Arms, and in a few moments overthrowing all that came

The <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſtill made ſome reſiſtance, by ſetting fire to the planchards, thereby to ſtop thoſe who purſued them and the Victory; but perceiving, that during the Combat, thoſe below had opened a breach in the Wall, and were now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter at it, they called for quarter, and yielded themſelves to the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who generouſly gave them their lives. Beſides thoſe who were ſlain in this furious Aſſault, which laſted from nine of the Clock in the morning till the next day at noon, and thoſe who in the Night endeavoured to make their eſcape by the Windows, whereof ſome where drowned and others ſlain by thoſe who in the Ship accompanied the Machin, there were about one hundred, who were taken in the Tower and made Slaves. So ſoon as the Tower was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Chriſtrians</hi> unlocked the Chain, which ſhut up the great Chanal, and all the Fleet had Liberty to enter and to attack the City upon the ſide of the Water.</p>
                  <p>The news of this loſs touched <hi>Saphadin</hi> ſo nearly, that in a few days after, while he was making Preparation to come to the relief of <hi>Damiata,</hi> he died of Grief in his Palace at <hi>Caire.</hi> He was a Prince who yielded nothing to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the great <hi>Saladin,</hi> either in good or ill Qualities. For if his ambition had made him uſurp the Kingdoms of the Eaſt, by the Murder of his Nephews, as <hi>Saladin</hi> had ſeized upon that of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Murder of the laſt <hi>Caliph,</hi> he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as much Courage, Valour, Addreſs and good Fortune, to maintain himſelf in them, as had that great Conqueror, who made himſelf Maſter of them and poſſeſſed them till his death. He had alſo this advantage above him, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, he divided his Empire among ſix of his Sons, nine others, which he had, ſatisfying themſelves without Jealouſie with the Revenues, which he aſſigned them for their ſubſſiſtance; they alſo rendred him continually a perfect Obedience, and a reſpect approaching even to Adoration: for this Prince, who was extreme politick, and throughly acquainted with the Genius of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals, born to Servitude, maintained ſo great a Majeſty, that unleſs it were when he went to the Wars, and that he appeared at the head of his Army, and that in the greateſt Pomp imaginable, he was never ſeen in publick but ſix times in the Year, and then with more terror than joy to his Subjects, who durſt not look upon him but in the Poſture of proſtration, upon their Bellies with their Faces to the Earth. He left <hi>Egypt</hi> and Grand <hi>Caire,</hi> the Capital City of his Empire, to <hi>Meledin,</hi> his eldeſt Son, with Soveraign Authority over all his Brothers, who held their Dominions of him. <hi>Coradin</hi> the ſecond, and he, of his five other Sons, who moſt reſembled him, both in Valour and Ambition, Anger and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, had the Realms of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and for the other Provinces of the Higher <hi>Aſia,</hi> they were divided among the other four of his Sons, whom he made his Succeſſors in his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>The new Sultan <hi>Meledin,</hi> who was nothing ſo great a Soldier as his Father, and who was of an humour ſweet enough and pacifick for a <hi>Saraſin,</hi> nevertheleſs did not fail, with a great deal of Care, to make the Preparations, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phadin</hi> had begun for the relief of the beſieged; <hi>Coradin</hi> alſo his Brother, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with whom during this War, he always acted by concert, and who underſtood it far better than himſelf, prepared on his ſide a puiſſant Army and demoliſhed moſt of the Garriſons in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and, among the reſt, the Fortreſs of <hi>Thabor,</hi> to reinforce thoſe Garriſons, which he ſtill kept there. As for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they did not make that uſe of their Victory, which they ought to have done in vigorouſly preſſing the Siege; but as if after this great Succeſs, they could not fail of Victory, they ſuffered a great deal of time to ſlip away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enterprizing any new thing, againſt the beſieged, taking unſeaſonably that repoſe, which they ought to have deferred till after their Conqueſt. There were alſo divers, who by a baſe deſertion, contrary to their Vow, reimbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to return into <hi>Europe,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Prohibitions, which the Patriarch could make, and all the threatnings of the Judgments of God, by which he endeavoured, tho to little purpoſe, to ſtay them.

For ſix thouſand of theſe Deſerters, who followed <hi>Hervey de Leon,</hi> a Gentleman of the lower <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> the death of whoſe Brother made him return into <hi>France</hi> to ſeize upon his Eſtate, having been a long time toſſed with a furious Tempeſt near the Coaſts of <hi>Italy,</hi> periſhed by a miſerable Shipwrack in View of the very Port of <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> not above fourſcore of theſe miſerable men being ſaved upon the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Planks.

                  <p>But nevertheleſs the loſs, which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army ſuffered by this deſertion, was quickly repaired by the Arrival of diverſe Troops of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who being excited by the Letters, which Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> had writ continually to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> arrived one after another during all the <hi>Autumm.</hi> The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>d' Alban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There came alſo from <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Venice, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> and many from <hi>France,</hi> who inbarked at <hi>Genoa,</hi> with <hi>Robert de Corceone,</hi> an Engliſh man, Cardinal of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> upon <hi>Mount-Coelius,</hi> whom the Pope ordered to accompany them in this Voyage. The moſt ſignal of thoſe, who with the conſent of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, went from <hi>France,</hi> were the Counts <hi>Hervey de Nevers, Hugh de la Marche, Miles de Barr,</hi> upon the <hi>Seine</hi> with his Sons, and the Lords, <hi>John d' Artois, Ponce de Grancey, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier de Tacy, Savary de Mauleon;</hi> and among the Prelates, <hi>William</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux, William de Beaumont,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angers, Gautier</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autun, Miles de Chaſtillon de Nantueil,</hi> Biſhop Elect of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> with <hi>Andrew</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Peter de Nemours,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gautier</hi> great Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain of <hi>France,</hi> and Brother to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> and <hi>Noyon.</hi> This good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, after he had for ten years governed with great Wiſdom the Church of the Capital City of the Realm, where he took great care to maintain the Purity of the Faith againſt the Errors of <hi>Amauri</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> which he cauſed to be condemned, reſolved alſo to ſignaliſe his Zeal againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> by taking upon him the Croſs, with which he gloriouſly conſummated that kind of Martyrdom at <hi>Damiata,</hi> where he died after the taking of the City. Prince <hi>Oliver</hi> alſo, the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> came by the ſame paſſage in <hi>September,</hi> with the Earls of <hi>Cheſter, Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>William de Harcourt</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Gallant Troop of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had devoted themſelves to the Holy War.</p>
                  <p>The Legate being arrived with ſo conſiderable a Succour, preſented to the King of Jeruſalem, the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the other Princes, the Letters by which the Pope, after having extremely commended the Cardinal, informed them, that he had ſent him principally to create and preſerve a perfect Union in the Army, and to animate them to do well by going before them, not with the Pomp and Majeſty of a Prince to command, but with that humility worthy of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he repreſented, and for whoſe Cauſe the <hi>Cruſades</hi> in taking up his Croſs had obliged themſelves to combat. But it muſt be avowed, that this good Prelate, did very ill acquit himſelf of his Charge, and acted directly contrary to the Intentions of the Pope, and the good Inſtructions which he had given him. For at the firſt Conference, which he had with King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> to whom all the Chief of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> yielded Obedience, he told him plainly and without a Complement, that he was reſolved to command the Army, alledging for his reaſon, that the Church having commanded the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and that the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> who were come to the relief of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> were not Subjects of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but depended upon the Church, by the Authority whereof they had taken upon them the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>The King was extremely ſurprized with ſuch a fooliſh Propoſition, which he had ſo little expected; but as he was very diſcreet, he did not declare it, leſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64918:163"/>he ſhould be obliged openly to break with a man, whoſe Ambition,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> which keeps no meaſures, eſpecially when it is ſupported by a great name, might carry him to dangerous Extremities, in abuſing a Power and Authority, which Jeſus Chriſt hath not given to the Church, but for the ſpiritual Kingdom, which is not of this World, as he himſelf aſſures us, and hath nothing to do with the Temporal. On the other ſide, notwithſtanding this, as this Prince had a great Soul, he was reſolved to do nothing to ſtain his Honour, or to leſſen the Auguſt Character of Royalty, which he was reſolved to ſupport, with the utmoſt Vigour, againſt all that ſhould enterprize any thing againſt it. He therefore kept fair with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, he made no direct anſwer to any thing which he ſaid, but would turn the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome other Subject, always treating him with extraordinary Civility; but in the ſame time he continued more poſitively than ever to give out his Orders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of any other Perſon, and cauſed them to be exactly obeyed, and acted in all things ſo like an abſolute Maſter and a King, that the good Legate at laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he had to do with a Prince, who in rendring to God with a profound Veneration, that which was due to him, knew alſo continually how to maintain the Rights that appertained to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This nevertheleſs did not fail to occaſion ſome Trouble in the Army, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the principal Officers; for thoſe who found themſelves any ways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the King, inclined always to the Legate, and he finding himſelf able to do nothing more, uſually came to the Council only to give his Opinion in contradiction to the King. But at length the Arrival of the Sultan <hi>Meledin,</hi> who came down the <hi>Nile</hi> to <hi>Damiata,</hi> with a potent Army, before the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had paſſed the River to beſiege the City by Land, obliged all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to re-unite, and recover the time which they had waſted and loſt by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Negligence, and ſeriouſly to diſpoſe themſelves to Combat the Enemy. After ſome light Skirmiſhes, wherein the <hi>Saraſins</hi> were conſtantly beaten, upon the thirtieth of <hi>November</hi> there aroſe ſuch a furious Tempeſt, that the Sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Waters of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and breaking over all the Banks, the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had like to have periſhed by the Inundation; many of the Ships were driven aſhoar and beaten in pieces, and four great Veſſels, upon which there were Caſtles built in order to attack the City, were driven by the Wind and the Waves, againſt the Towers and the Walls, where they were unfortunately Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the Wildfire which the Beſieged with eaſe threw into them, in the ſight of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who during that dreadful Storm were not able to Relieve them. Several Knights of the Temple, who were in another great Ship, which the Tempeſt had alſo forced to the Shoar near the City, ſeeing, after they had fought moſt valiantly for a long time, that it was impoſſible to reſiſt the infinite number of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who having on all ſides ſurrounded them, and making themſelves Maſters of the Veſſel, threw themſelves in Shoals upon her, they imitated <hi>Samſon,</hi> and reſolved to bury themſelves together with their Enemies; for boreing Holes in the Ship, they let in the Water ſo faſt, that during the Combat ſhe ſunk in a Moment to the Bottom, nothing but the top of the main Maſt appearing above the Water. And certainly all had been loſt, if God in Mercy had not been intreated by the inceſſant Prayers and Tears of the Biſhops, who continued Night and Day in Prayers to implore his Pity and Compaſſion, and that upon the third day he was pleaſed to cauſe the Tempeſt to ceaſe, ſo that the River returned to its Chanal, and the Waters again came to their old Courſe, to run within their Banks.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Tempeſt was over, the Army, which had ſaved themſelves by getting upon the higher Grounds, returned to their Camp, and ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ten Soldiers, <hi>Friſelanders</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> performed an Action ſo Heroick, as aſtoniſhed both the <hi>Saraſins</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were equally the Spectators and Admirers of it. For the Enemy having repaired their Bridge of Boats, which hindred the Ships from paſſing up the River to the Place where the Army was reſolved to paſs the <hi>Nile;</hi> theſe ten brave reſolute Men, having put themſelves into two Shallops, undertook to gain it and break the Bridge. They ſet upon it then in open day, and mounting it, chaſed thoſe who defended it, with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Blows of the Sword, from their Poſts, and having made themſelves Maſters of it, whileſt ſome of them fought at the Entrance of the Bridge to defend it
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64918:164"/>againſt all the Forces of the City,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1218</label> as ſometimes the famous <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> had done at <hi>Rome,</hi> oppoſing the whole Army of <hi>Porſenna</hi> upon a Bridge of the <hi>Tiber;</hi> others of them broak this Bridge of Boats, and in deſpight of the fearful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of Stones, Darts, and Wildfire, which were ſhowred upon them from the Ramparts and Towers of the City, they brought off diverſe of the Boats which compoſed the Bridge, as it were in Triumph, to their Companions, who with the loud noiſe of Drums, Trumpets, and Acclamations, celebrated the Praiſes of their Victory, and an Action which well deſerves to be conſecrated to their eternal Glory and the Knowledge of Poſterity by immortal Hiſtory. So that this Obſtacle being removed all the Ships ſailed up above the City,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1219</label> and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines being ſitted for the Combat, the Reſolution was taken to paſs to the other ſide of the River, and Land in the ſight of the Sultan, who had fortified all the Bank with good Retrenchments, behind which his Army was drawn up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia in the great Lines, which being ranged upon a riſing Ground like a kind of Amphitheatre, gave them the Opportunity of diſcharging all their Arrows and Darts together upon the Enemy, without being in danger of hurting one another.</p>
                  <p>And in truth it did not only ſeem a moſt temerarious Action to attempt a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſo well defended, but wholly impoſſible to ſucceed. But God was pleaſed in an inſtant to open it, againſt all Appearance, by one of the moſt extraordinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents imaginable, and which could not reaſonably be attributed to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Providence, which he hath for thoſe whom he hath taken into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For the ſame Night, which was the fourth, or fifth of <hi>February,</hi> and that all things were diſpoſed to adventure the Paſſage the Morrow of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day, the Sultan <hi>Meledin</hi> with his Emirs, and the principal Commanders of the Army, leaving in his Camp the moſt reſolute of his Troops to receive the Enemy, not doubting but they would be able to do it, he poſted with full ſpeed towards <hi>Caire,</hi> as if he had been purſued by a victorious Army after a mighty Overthrow; nor could there ever be aſſigned any Reaſon for this precipitate Flight, but that ſort of Terror which God ſometimes fills the Hearts of thoſe withal, whom he will puniſh, and of which we find frequent Examples in the Holy Scriptures. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Renegade, who had for a long time ſerved the Sultan, and who was big with the Deſire of being the firſt Diſcoverer of a thing ſo aſtoniſhing, came running to the Bank of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and called aloud in <hi>French,</hi> that they ſhould paſs over immediately, for that the Sultan had forſaken his Men and was fled; deſiring them preſently to ſend a Skiff, as they did, to take him in, that ſo they might be the better aſſured of what he told them. In this time the Army of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſeeing themſelves abandoned by the Sultan, believing themſelves betrayed, they disbanded, and preſently fled after him in the greateſt Fear and Diſorder. So that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> raviſhed to ſee ſuch a viſible Effect of the divine Protection, paſſed the River without Reſiſtance; but not altogether without Difficulty, in regard that the Banks of the <hi>Nile</hi> were ſo Muddy and Slimy on that ſide, that the Horſes, whom they led by the Bridles, being up to the Saddle Skirts in the Quick-Sands and Quagmires, did not gain the Bank without extreme Trouble; which made it clearly appear that if there had been but a few Defendants, it had been almoſt impoſſible to have forced it. As ſoon as all the Army was paſſed over, they entred into the Camp of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins,</hi> which they plundred, and then they took up their Quarters about the City, which was invironed with good Lines, and a great Ditch, which was drawn from one Part to the other, to the River <hi>Nile,</hi> upon which they built a Bridge of Boats, that ſo they might have a Communication with thoſe who were incamped on the other ſide the River to guard the Ships upon which the Attack was to be made upon the ſide next the Water.</p>
                  <p>There was neceſſity however of making uſe of all manner of Precautions; for as the City was extreme ſtrong, ſo there were in it fourty thouſand Men who were reſolved to make a brave Defence; it was alſo Winter, and many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, eſpecially the Scurvy, raged among the Soldiers, and many died of them. The Siege was like to prove long, ſo that the Enemies had leiſure to come to the Relief of the Beſieged, with potent Armies.

                  <p>And in truth <hi>Coradin,</hi> who was a brave, and a great Captain, attempted the lines three ſeveral times with all the Vigour imaginable, and particularly upon Palm Sunday, having made himſelf Maſter of the Bridge, which joined the two Camps, he had forced them on that ſide, if the brave Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who with the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Templers</hi> came ruſhing in upon him, had not chocked his Succeſs, and at laſt repulſed him after a moſt obſtinate Combat, maintained from morning till it was high noon. This was the laſt of thoſe fair actions which that gallant Duke perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> for having on one ſide accompliſhed his vow, having ſtaid in the <hi>Levant</hi> above ſix Months longer than the time of Service which he had only vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a year; and on the other ſide his own Affairs recalling him into his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions he took Sea in the Spring; and this example was quickly followed by a great number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who wearied with the length, and the inconveniences of the Siege returned into <hi>Europe.</hi> So that the Army being extremely weakned by this retreat, and the diſeaſes, ran the Fortune of being at laſt forced in their retrenchments, if the great Succours of new <hi>Cruſades</hi> of all Nations, whom the Pope preſſed continually to part from all the Ports of <hi>Italy,</hi> had not come moſt ſeaſonable in the very nick of time with great plenty of all manner of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in abundance, of which the beſiegers ſtood in great want.</p>
                  <p>And certainly the arrival of theſe recruits was no more than neceſſary; for ſhortly after, <hi>Meledin</hi> having recovered his courage out of the Swound into which it had fallen, raiſed an Army more numerous than the firſt, and marched to join his Brother <hi>Coradin,</hi> that ſo with their joint forces they might make one great attempt for all upon the Camp of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was then in no condition of reſiſting them; ſo ſoon therefore as the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time to make all the Preparations for ſo great an Action was over, theſe two great Armies of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> having ranged themſelves in Battalia, early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the laſt day of <hi>July,</hi> preſented themſelves in good order before the Lines, and made four or five ſeveral attacks, thereby to divide the forces of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which notwithſtanding their recruits, were not by far ſo numerous as theirs. It was fought with incredible heat and Fury on the one ſide, and the other; the <hi>Saraſins</hi> animated by the preſence of their <hi>Sultans</hi> and the certain hope they had conceived, that they ſhould that day deliver the beſieged City: the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the fatal neceſſity to which they were reduced, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the Enemy, or to be all cut in pieces, their camp being ſhut up, between two mighty Armies, an Enemies City, and a great River, over which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to eſcape. In this time, thoſe who attacked the quarter of the Knights <hi>Templers,</hi> made ſuch a vigorous impreſſion, and returned ſo often to the Aſſault, that they forced the Lines on that ſide, entered the Camp, charged furiouſly upon the Infantry, whom the Knights had poſted for the defence of that place, and preſſed ſo ſtoutly upon them, that at length they put them to ſlight, and purſued their point ſo briskly, being followed by their reſerves, who came crouding after them into the lines, that the intire ruin of the Army ſeemed inevitable, when the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> arriving in good time with their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64918:165"/>Swords in their hands,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1219</label> made theſe fierce Enemies ſtop ſhort in their carreer, and again turned the Face of the Combat.</p>
                  <p>For being all Freſh men, and deſirous above all things to ſignalize their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage by ſome gallant action, they charged the Enemy according to their manner, with ſo much fury that they forced them to recoil, and beat them back again to the Lines, where the <hi>Saraſins</hi> finding themſelves ſuſtained by thoſe without, who continually mounted over the Works, they alſo took their turn and as they had been themſelves beaten back, ſo now they made the <hi>French</hi> retreat. But in a minute after, the ſhame and madneſs, which they had to be thus baſſed, redoubling their Courage and their Strength, they came up to the Charge again, and three ſeveral times fell upon the Enemy with ſuch irreſiſtable Valour, that being unable to ſuſtain their Fury, they tumbled over the Lines and into the ditch; when at the ſame time thoſe of the City making a notably Sally, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire to the <hi>Machins,</hi> which put the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> into great fear and diſorder, gave them the opportunity of regaining their advantage. Thereupon the great Maſter of the Temple, and the other of the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, who haſted to their relief, obſerving that the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who believed themſelves aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Victory, advanced with precipitation and diſorder, ſhouting for Joy as they ran to the Charge, they marched to charge them in the Flanks on both ſides, whileſt the <hi>French</hi> who now took new Courage by the ſight of theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours attacked them in the Front; ſo that being beſet on three ſides by ſo many Valiant men, whom the danger of loſing all had rendred furious, they were almoſt all cut in pieces, and thoſe who followed them were chaſed over the Lines and the Ditch, which was almoſt filled up with the heaps of the ſlain. After which the Army falling upon thoſe of the Town who had made the Sally, they were preſently repulſed with a moſt dreadful Slaughter, though notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had firſt deſtroyed a great number of <hi>Machins</hi> by ſetting them on fire, which could not in that great Confuſion be ſuddainly quenched. Thus ended this great Battle which laſted from morning until night. On the other ſide, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Piſans</hi> and <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who were wholly managed by the Legate, were not much more fortunate in their Enterpriſe, and though they had aſſured him the Succeſs was infallible, yet they happened to be miſtaken; for all the new <hi>Machins,</hi> which they had built upon four great Ships, were in ſeveral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, which they gave to little purpoſe, either broken by the Engines of the Town, or burnt by the <hi>Greek</hi> Wildfire, from which they were never able to ſecure them.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt of all the evils, which the Beſiegers ſuffered, was the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which happened between the Infantry and Cavalry, which had like in one day to have ruined the whole Army. For the Cavalry in thoſe times was in a manner wholly compoſed of Gentlemen, who loved their eaſe and pleaſure ſo much that they left the Foot to all the hard duty, and exempted themſelves from it. The Foot, who believed themſelves undervalued, loudly murmured againſt them, reproaching them with want of Courage, and accuſing them of leaving them to ſhift for themſelves in the moſt dangerous combats. On the contrary, the Cavalry maintained the quite contrary, ſaying, the Foot did nothing at all, as appeared plainly in the laſt Battle within the Lines, where the Infantry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves good Footman in running for it, and that all had been infallibly loſt, if the Cavalry had not ſpurred up to their aſſiſtance, and almoſt alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the Enemies. So that by the moſt fooliſh and ſtrange adventure that ever was ſeen in an Army, both Horſe and Foot, that they might manifeſt who had the greateſt Courage and moſt Valour, compelled the King to lead them againſt the Enemy and oblige them to a Battle.</p>
                  <p>It was then that St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> who by the earneſt deſire which he had to gain the Crown of Martyrdom, by preaching the Faith to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> was come to the Camp at <hi>Damiata;</hi> and contrary to his cuſtom, in medling with matters, which were not religious or agreable to his Profeſſion, oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtoutly againſt this fooliſh Reſolution. And the Spirit of God being an Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the divine Wiſdom upon us, which agrees perfectly with good ſenſe and reaſon, made him predict with a great deal of reaſon to theſe fooliſh Braves, that if they would be ſo raſh, to undertake ſuch an ill grounded Enrerpriſe, it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64918:165"/>would prove fatal to them.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1219</label> But theſe People could hear no other Language but that of their Paſſions, and ſuch was their Fury that they compelled their Captains to go along with them, making little Account of what St. <hi>Francis</hi> threatned them withal, who was a man of no preſence, and whom they did not believe to be a Prophet. Leaving therefore a few men to guard the Camp, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Beſieged, they marched againſt the Enemy in Battalia, upon the nine and twentieth day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The <hi>Saraſins</hi> upon the ſight of them drew off, and retreated into a large Champaign between the <hi>Nile</hi> and the Sea, where there being no water, and the ſeaſon exceſſive hot, they were reduced to the utmoſt extremities of wearineſs and thirſt and broak all their Ranks and order, to ſearch for water to refreſh themſelves. The <hi>Saraſins</hi> then, who waited for this diſorder, to make advantage of it, immediately faced about, and came pouring upon the <hi>Cyprus</hi> Cavalry, which was upon the left Wing, and charging them in the Flank, broak them, and diſſipated them in a moment; whereupon the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Infantry, who were covered by them, preſently fled, and after them the Horſe, the Legate and Patriarch, who carried the Croſs, being not able to ſtop them: and in ſhort all had been infallibly loſt that day, if the King, who was in the main Battle, perceiving the horrible diſorder, and letting the Fugitives paſs by him, that they might not hinder his march, had not inſtantly advanced, being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Knights of the three orders, the <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> who ſtopped the Purſuit of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and made good an honourable retreat to their Camp, where the Army entred well mortified with the ill Fortune which they had met withal in this fooliſh adventure. For they loſt above ſix thouſand men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Priſoners, among which were the Biſhop of of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Andrew de Chaſtillon Nantueil, Gautier de Nemours</hi> Brother of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Paris, John d' Arcis,</hi> and <hi>Henry de l' Orme,</hi> the Marſhal of the order of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and above thirty Knights of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Prediction of the holy man St. <hi>Francis d' Aſſiſe</hi> was accompliſhed; but he purſuing his principal deſign, wandered from the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Camp, and permitted himſelf to be taken by the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who, after they had given him a thouſand blows, preſented him to <hi>Meledin,</hi> to get the reward which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to thoſe who ſhould bring him a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> dead or alive. The good man notwithſtanding this, preached the Goſpel to him with an admirable Zeal, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the Flames for the proof of the truth thereof. But he laboured in vain as to the deſign which he had propounded to himſelf, being neither able to gain the Crown of Martyrdom, by reaſon that the Sultan, charmed with his diſcourſe, his Patience, and his Vertue, was ſo far from putting him to death, that he gave him a thouſand carreſſes, and all the obliging Uſage imaginable; nor could he obtain the Converſion of this Prince, the fear in which he was of his Subjects being more prevalent with him than the truth which was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him. So that the Saint finding there was no good to be done, took his way back again, and the Prayers which the Sultan, whoſe preſents he refuſed, deſired of him for his Salvation proved ineffectual by the juſt Judgement of God, who rigorouſly puniſhes thoſe, who either out of fear or malice, refuſe his Grace and the tenders of Salvation: For the Authors who have written for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that in Virtue of his Prayers, this Sultan was converted, and baptized before his Death, are under a miſtake of the Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> who never ſaw St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who this very year of the Siege, of <hi>Damiata</hi> received Baptiſm at his death, whereas this Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> neither died that year nor was ever baptized. And it is a great weakneſs, to give it no worſe Title, to make ſuch fabulous relations of holy men; for the Saints, who in Heaven enjoy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite happineſs, do neither deſire nor ſtand in neceſſity, that thoſe who write their lives, or make their Elogies ſhould give them praiſes upon Earth that are not true, whether it be in magnifiing their Actions, or in attributing to them ſuch miracles as may well be doubted, and rationally diſproved, and which is the moſt abominable and pernicious flattery, making them ſo perfect in all things, as to be free from all manner of ſin. That which is certainly true in this matter is, That Sultan <hi>Meledin</hi> not only treated St. <hi>Francis,</hi> but after this the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and particularly the Priſoners with great humanity, ſending ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of them to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Camp to treat of a Peace.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1219</label> This Sultan, who was a better Politician them a Soldier, underſtood very well, that notwithſtanding his Victory, he had many preſſing Conſiderations to move him to labour all he could for a Peace. All the proviſions in the City were almoſt ſpent, the Siege having continued ſo long that by reaſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, many deſeaſes began to make a cruel Ravage among the defendants, ſo that he could not hope, having ſo often deceived them with vain promiſes, but that they muſt come to a Capitulation, and beſides he himſelf began to be ſtraitned in proviſions for his Army; by reaſon that the Beſiegers being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Sea with a ſtrong Fleet, received them in abundance and hindred all others from furniſhing his Army with ſupplies, ſo that it was impoſſible for him longer to ſubſiſt in the Poſts which now he was in. Moreover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the <hi>Nile</hi> having not been very favourable this year, he feared, that the ſcarcity which he foreſaw, would not permit him to raiſe or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Army if he ſhould be obliged to continue the War; that after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Damiata,</hi> he ſhould not therefore be in a condition of reſiſting the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who would infallibly march againſt him in Grand <hi>Caire.</hi> For theſe reaſons therefore, after the Retreat of diverſe of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who had reimbarked themſelves for <hi>Europe</hi> in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> having again made an unſucceſsful attempt againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to force them in their retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the conſent of his Brother <hi>Coradin</hi> he ſent to propoſe a Peace, or at leaſt a Truce for ſeveral years, upon Conditions, which were very fair and advantageous to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which were as follow, <hi>That he would reſtore</hi> to them the true Croſs; which was taken by <hi>Saladin</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Tyberias; That he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the King all that they held in the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and That he would give ſo much money as ſhould be ſufficient to rebuild the Walls of that City, and put it into the ſame Condition wherein it was before; That he would releaſe all the Priſoners which had been taken in</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Syria, <hi>not only during this, but all the preceding Wars; That the ſtrong holds of</hi> Thoron, <hi>of</hi> Sephet, <hi>and</hi> Beaufort <hi>ſhould be ſurrendred to the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in the ſame condition which they were now in; and in ſhort, that he would keep nothing but the two Cities of</hi> Crac, <hi>and</hi> Montreal <hi>on the other ſide of</hi> Jordan, <hi>in regard they were neceſſary for the Security of the Pilgrims, which ſhould travel to</hi> Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, <hi>and that theſe two Cities ſhould alſo be in ſome ſort under the Authority of the King of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>by paying to him a moderate acknowledgement of tribute during the time of the peace or Truce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this being a deciſive affair, there was an Aſſembly called of all the Commanders, and Prelates, and the queſtion was debated, Whether leaving the Enterpriſe of <hi>Damiata,</hi> the Propoſitions of the two Sultans ought not to be accepted. The opinions were diverſe, the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Lords and great Officers among the <hi>French, Engliſh, Germans, Flemings,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> were of the opinion, that they ought to be received; and without doubt this Judgment was founded upon reaſons equally plauſible and ſubſtantial. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>that which ought to govern us in this deliberation, is the end which we have propoſed to our ſelves in undertaking this War: And what is that end? Is it not to reconquer the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to recover the Sepulchre of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>out of the hands of the Infidels, for the deliverance whereof ſo many</hi> Cruſades, <hi>have from time to time been undertaken? Nor had we beſieged</hi> Damiata, <hi>but upon the belief that the taking of that City would prove the moſt proper and conducive means to arrive at that end; and although we have now beſieged the place for ſeventeen Months, yet we have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and it is uncertain when we ſhall, ſince not only our one Soldiers daily quit the tedious Service, but the Enemies receive daily reinforcements, and redouble their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, which we did not without difficulty, reſist, even when we were ſtronger, and the Events of War being uncertain, it is but reaſonable to accept thoſe offers now, which we would willingly have embraced before the Siege. That it is but to quit a certainty for an uncertainty to refuſe them, and that what we aim at ultimately is now offered unto us. That when we have taken</hi> Damiata, <hi>we ſhould be willing to exchange it for the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſince that is the only reaſon for which we endeavour to take it, and there is all the reaſon in the World to accept that now which will deliver the Army from all future difficulties and dangers in continuing the Siege, and not only ſpare the blood of ſo many brave men as were dayly loſt before the Town, but alſo the expoſing of the whole Army to the diſgrace of not taking it at the laſt, that if as might be objected, it
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64918:166"/>was to be feared, that the</hi> Saraſins <hi>never intended to perform the Condition,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1219</label> which they ſo liberally offered, it was eaſie to aſſure themſelves of performance, by taking ſufficient Hoſtages from them; and that admitting the worst, they might ſo fortifie</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>before the Army ſeparated, and before the Enemies could be in a Condition to obſtruct them, as to render it impregnable for the future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide the Legate, who rarely was in the ſame Opinion with the King, and who wanted neither Wit nor reaſon to ſupport his own, ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>That theſe Propoſitions ought by no means to be accepted; That this was nothing but the pure Artifice of the</hi> Sultans, <hi>to prevent the taking of the City, which they found it was impoſſble for them to relieve; That all they offered being now only a naked Country, and defenceleſs Villages, it was eaſie to take it from them without the help of a Treaty; That the</hi> Infidels <hi>had no other intention, by all theſe ſeeming advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which they offered to the Chriſtians, but to ſeparate their Army, by a deluſive Peace, that ſo they might afterwards with eaſe recover, what they had yielded to them only to amuſe them. And for what concerned the true Croſs, they were certainly informed that the</hi> Saraſins <hi>had ſuffered it to be loſt or deſtroyed; ſince</hi> Saladin, <hi>if after the moſt diligent ſearch he could have found it, would moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have reſtored it, for the Ranſom of ſo many Valiant men, and ſo many conſiderable Emirs, as were made Priſoners upon the taking of</hi> Ptolemais. <hi>And in ſhort, that the Siege was now ſo far advanced, that the Defendants being reduced to the laſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, it was impoſſible but they muſt take</hi> Damiata, <hi>and that after that, it was eaſie to know what they had to do, and that then they might if they pleaſed, treat with more Honour and more advantage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Legate had a ſtrong Party, and a great authority eſpecially among the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and that his reaſons alſo were not without a Foundation of great Probability, the Patriarch, the Arch-Biſhops, the Biſhops, and all the Eccleſiaſticks, together with the three great Maſters of the Military Orders, all the <hi>Italians,</hi> and many other <hi>Cruſades</hi> were in his Opinion; ſo that the others alſo ſtanding firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Senſe, the whole Army was divided, and in perpetual conteſts for ſeveral days. But the Sultan, who made uſe of that Opportunity to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put ſome ſuccour into the place, during this diſcourſe of Peace, the King's Party, which was the leaſt, reunited again with the Legate. Hereupon the Conferences for Peace were broken, and it was reſolved to purſue the Siege with all imaginable Vigor. But it laſted not long, for one of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which lay upon a Corner of the Town, being by the force of the <hi>Machins</hi> ſo ruined, that it was eaſie to enter by the Breach, and there appearing no great number of Defendants to ſecure the Breach, the Legate made choice of a very dark night wherein the Wind blew very loud, to cauſe it to be attacked. The Soldiers approached the Tower and the Gate adjoining, which they ſet on ſire, and paſſed to the ſecond Wall, whileſt others clapt up Ladders, and ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt Wall in diverſe places without reſiſtance; then the King being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately advertiſed of this ſtrange Succeſs led his Troops thither in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with the ſame facility gained the ſecond Wall; and the next morning being the fifth of November by break of day they took the third Wall with ſo little reſiſtance, that there was but one man lightly wounded in his Foot Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Standards were planted upon the Towers, which the Sultans perceiving, they retired with precipitation, ſetting fire to their Camp and Bridge, that ſo they might not be purſued.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Damiata,</hi> which had coſt ſo much Blood and labour for eighteen Months, was in one night taken by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army without Noiſe, without Tumult, there being none left in this fair and great City in Condition to defend it. For the extreme Famine which they had indured, and the diſeaſes which followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, had made ſuch a horrible ravage, that of eighty thouſand Soldiers and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens which were in it at the Beginning of the Siege, there were ſcarcely leſt three thouſand alive, and of thoſe not above one hundred, who were able to bear Arms. All the Streets and houſes were filled with dead and dying Perſons, which the living, who with extreme weakneſs expected the ſame Fate, were not able to bury; ſo that the Army was forced for a long time to encamp without the City before they could get it cleanſed. There were found in the City infinite Riches in Veſſels of Gold, Silver, Pearls, precious Stones, Silks and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1220</label> and a long Beard which reaches down to their very Girdle. They are in the main, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple well proportioned and of a good Mind, kind and obliging to Strangers, terrible to their Enemies, great Soldiers, extremely brave, even to the very Women, who like <hi>Amazons,</hi> will go to the Wars and ſight moſt valiantly; and they are ſo taken notice off for this Valour above all other of the Eaſtern <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> either out of Fear or reſpect, permit them to enter with their Colours flying like Soldiers into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and without paying any thing when they come to viſit the Holy Sepulchre. But they have this great Blemiſh that they are moſt intolerable Drinkers, and make little account of ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as will not debauch with them, having entertained a brutiſh perſuaſion, that it is impoſſible for any perſons to be truely valiant, who are not exceſſive Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of drinking. So that they never go to the Combat till they have well drunk; for which purpoſe they always carry to the field, a Bottle of Wine tied to their Girdles, and before they begin the Battle they preſently and with Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs toſs it off to the laſt drop, and then furiouſly charge the Enemies, being elevated with the Wine and half drunk.</p>
                  <p>This was the Temper of theſe <hi>Georgians,</hi> who were now moſt highly incenſed againſt <hi>Coradin,</hi> becauſe without conſulting them, he had cauſed the Walls of the Holy City to be demoliſhed during the Siege of <hi>Damiata;</hi> for which, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Injury done to all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in General, they loudly threatned to be avenged on him. For this purpoſe ſo ſoon as they heard the news of the taking of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,</hi> their King writ to the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> to give them joy of their Victory, and to exhort them to follow their good Fortune, aſſuring them, that for his own particular,, as he ſhould eſteem it a diſhonour to him not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the glorious Example, which they had given him, ſo he was reſolved in favour of them to make a powerful diverſion in <hi>Syria,</hi> and to attack <hi>Coradin</hi> even in his Capital City of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> But all theſe fair hopes of chaſing the <hi>Inſidels</hi> out of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> quickly vaniſhed by two unhappy Accidents, which ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Eaſt. The firſt was, that as the King of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> was preparing for this Holy War, he received advice that the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who began to make diverſe Conqueſts in <hi>Aſia,</hi> were ready to fall into his Dominions; and this hindred this Valiant Prince from executing what he had ſo generouſly reſolved againſt <hi>Coradin.</hi> The ſecond was the deplorable misfortune, which befel the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, which having loſt a great deal of time, had at laſt took the field to endeavour to finiſh in conquering the reſt of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> what they had ſo happily begun, by taking the ſtrongeſt of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Realm, and it is this which I am now to treat of, and in few words to give an Account of the Cauſes of this ſad event.</p>
                  <p>After that the Army had paſſed the Winter at <hi>Damiata,</hi> and the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, to recover themſelves from ſo many Fatigues, they were ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Condition to purſue their Conqueſts, in the Beginning of the Spring, that they found themſelves more weak than at the end of the Siege; for many of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> of all Nations, believing that they had fully accompliſhed their Vow, and being weary of a tedious War, returned into their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and that which weakned them ſtill more, was, that the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who commanded the Army, quitted them and returned into <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> This King, who was in no ſort ſatisfied with the Legate, who had ſo often ſhocked him, and with whom he found it impoſſible to keep himſelf in any good Terms, was not at all ſorry to have a fair pretext to retire himſelf; and the death of <hi>Livon</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which then happened, furniſhed him with a plauſible reaſon, to go and purſue the Right of the Queen, his Wife, who, in Oppoſition to the Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> pretended that that Realm appertained to her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he ſaid, that having heard that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> of <hi>Alepo,</hi> were fallen into the Territories of the <hi>Templers,</hi> he was obliged to go inſtantly to repel theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Neighbours, who made Advantage of his Abſence. So that notwithſtanding what ever the Legate could remonſtrate to him to ſtop his Journey, he left the Command of the Army to him, and imbarked with his Troops, he carried them with him to the City of <hi>Acre,</hi> promiſing nevertheleſs to return and join the Army ſo ſoon as he could. But the long ſtay, which he made to no purpoſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64918:169"/>at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1220</label> without either making War againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> or in <hi>Armenia,</hi> made it evident that the reaſons, which he alledged to juſtifie his retreat, were nothing but colourable pretences to withdraw himſelf. So that the <hi>Cruſades</hi> having not ſufficient Troops to guard the Conqueſts, and to march into the field, were conſtrained to paſs the Summer without doing any thing; and in the Interim they writ to the Pope to intreat him to haſten the Supplies of the New <hi>Cruſades,</hi> which were expected; and above all to procure the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> to put himſelf at the head of them, that ſo under ſo great a General, whoſe Commands no perſon would preſume to diſpute, there might be no more ſuch diviſions as might retard the progreſs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arms.</p>
                  <p>This Prince who had more than once promiſed that he would preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his Vow, yet continually put of the Voyage for reaſons, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very plauſible, pretended that the preſent poſture of the Affairs of the Empire, would not admit of his Abſence; and that he had not yet received the Crown Imperial at <hi>Rome,</hi> without which at that time they were ſcarcely thought to be compleat Emperors. The Pope therefore to take from him theſe Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which he had hitherto made uſe of, ſent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was ſolemnly crowned upon St. <hi>Cecily's</hi> day in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, together with the Empreſs <hi>Conſtance</hi> his Wife; there he again received the Croſs, and renewed his Vow to take the Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> giving his Promiſe and his Oath to the Pope thereupon; upon which Confidence the Pope writ to <hi>Damiata,</hi> to encourage the Legate and <hi>Cruſades,</hi> aſſuring them that in the Month of <hi>March</hi> in the following year, the Emperor would ſend before him, the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Metz</hi> his Great Chancellour with conſiderable Succours, and that he himſelf would follow in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> with all his forces.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1221</label> The firſt part of his Promiſe he exactly performed, and was ſomething better than his word; for beſides that <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> according to his promiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in the Spring with above four hundred Lords and Gentlemen, <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who conducted noble Troops, which arrived happily at <hi>Damiata;</hi> he alſo rigged out three and fourty Gallies out of the Ports of <hi>Sicily,</hi> under the Command of the Biſhop of <hi>Catania,</hi> Chancellour of that Realm. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and the <hi>Piſans</hi> alſo brought thither great reinforcements, as did the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Milan,</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> who were accompanied by many <hi>Italian</hi> Lords; inſomuch that the Legate who had a great longing to ſight, whileſt he commanded the Army, which he had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore drawn out to no purpoſe to meet the Enemy, and now believed that with this reinforcement, of ſo many brave Troops, he might more eaſily execute his Enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>He communicated his Deſign to the principal Commanders of the Army, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> and all the other Biſhops, who were conſtantly in the Council; and they who were very willing to be at his Devotion, were in his Opinion, and all concluded as he did, that ſuch a flouriſhing Army ought not to lie idle, but that without waiting any longer, they ought to march againſt the Sultan, who had not had much time to make his Preparations, and who would doubtleſs perfect his Levies if they ſhould any longer defer attacking of him. But the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and ſo many Lords as accompanied him, and generally all the Commanders, who were not pleaſed to ſee a Churchman at the Head of an Army as a General in the day of Battle, were unanimous in the opinion, that ſince the Emperor could not poſſibly come ſo ſoon as was deſired, they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> whom the whole Army deſired as their General, and who would moſt certainly be there in a very ſmall time.</p>
                  <p>And in truth the Pope having underſtood that this Prince was withdrawn in diſcontent, under pretence of the difference with the Prince of <hi>Antioch</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Armenia,</hi> had writ to him in very preſſing Terms to oblige him to return to <hi>Damiata;</hi> and all the Lords of the Army, who were reſolved to have a Captain of his Quality and Valour, preſſed him ſo ſtrongly to return and take the Command of the Army, that in four or five days he arrived at <hi>Damiata;</hi> and that which augmented the Joy of this happy return, which was ſo welcome, and had been ſo long hoped and wiſhed by the Army was, that Count <hi>Matthew,</hi> Governour of <hi>Pavia</hi> for the Emperor, came almoſt at the ſame time to anchor in the Port
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64918:169"/>of <hi>Damiata</hi> with eight Gallies, which <hi>Frederick,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1221</label> who was then in his Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> had ſent as a reinforcement, upon which were ſeven hundred of the moſt brave among the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who in their paſſage ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met with twelve great Ships of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> had ſunk four, chaced the reſt, and taken two of them, whom they brought in as the Trophees of their Victory to <hi>Damiata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this time <hi>Meledin,</hi> who had had leiſure to make advantage of this ſad diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſtill continued between the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Legate <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> being marched out of Grand <hi>Caire,</hi> accompanied with his two Brothers, <hi>Coradin,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and <hi>Seraph,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Alepo,</hi> and the greateſt part of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which together made the greateſt Army, which they had ever had, came and poſted himſelf a little above the place, where the <hi>Peluſiack</hi> and <hi>Tanitick,</hi> the two Eaſtern Chanals of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> divide themſelves from each other; there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched himſelf very ſtrongly, and built a Fortreſs which he called the new <hi>Damiata,</hi> with two Bridges, one upon the <hi>Peluſiack</hi> Chanal, for the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Communication with Grand <hi>Caire,</hi> which lies upon the Bank of the <hi>Nile</hi> on the right hand; and the other upon the Tanitick, to make his Excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as far as <hi>Damiata,</hi> that by this means he might draw the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country where he believed he ſhould moſt aſſuredly ruin them without running the hazard of coming to a Battle. And the Succeſs proved better for him than he had foreſeen or could have imagined. For immediately after the arrival of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a great Council was held to determine, what was to be undertaken with ſo brave an Army as was then together. There this Prince with great Judgement gave his Opinion, <hi>That beſides that it was extreme dangerous to engage the Army in ſuch a Country, particularly at that ſeaſon of the year, when the</hi> Nilus <hi>began to ſwell in order to its conſtant Immdation, it was alſo to no purpoſe to make any further Conqueſts there, which would weaken the Army, and not conduce in the leaſt to the great end, which they had propoſed to themſelves. For having</hi> Damiata <hi>and</hi> Tanis, <hi>which were the two ſtrongeſt places of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the two Keys of the Kingdom towards</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>they would certainly hinder the Sultan, who durſt never leave theſe two ſtrong places behind him, from going to the Aſſiſtance of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Coradin; <hi>and that before he could poſſbly regain them, they might eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the Holy Land, and rebuild Jeruſalem, which was the ultimate end of the</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade: <hi>And that after this, if the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>of the Weſt, had a deſire to recover</hi> Egypt <hi>from the</hi> Inſidels, <hi>they might make another</hi> Cruſade, <hi>to the Succeſs whereof, a King of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>well establiſhed in his Dominions, might contribute very much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other part the Legate, who after the taking of <hi>Damiata,</hi> to which without doubt, he had contributed in a great meaſure, and after the Retreat of <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> which ſhewed that he was in fear of him, was now become more hot, fierce and untractable, ſtrongly oppoſed this advice. And ſeeing himſelf ſupported in his Opinion, not only by the Biſhops, but by the greateſt part of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were lately come, who deſired nothing ſo much as to ſee the Enemy, he ſaid a hundred things with more heat than Prudence, to prove, <hi>That this was to betray the Common Cauſe, to let ſuch a fair opportunity eſcape them of cutting in pieces a patched Army, and conſequently the taking of Grand</hi> Caire, <hi>which had no manner of Fortifications, capable of reſiſting them; That beſides that this would be the moſt Illuſtrious action in the World, for the Glory of the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Name, this was to ſtrike directly at the Foundation of the</hi> Saraſin <hi>Empire, and the way to reverſe it from the top to the bottom; that after this glorious Conqueſt there would remain nothing either in</hi> Paleſtine <hi>or</hi> Syria, <hi>that could oppoſe the victorious Arms of the</hi> Chriſtians. And in ſhort this Legate, who was of an humour extremely Martial, ſaid ſo much, and that with Menaces of Excommunication againſt thoſe who ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, that the moſt ancient Captains among the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who when they had before oppoſed this Prelate, had not done it, but that the King was at their head; and the King himſelf fearing, that he ſhould render himſelf ſuſpected and might make the Soldiers believe, that he acted only for his particular Intereſt, ſuffered himſelf at length to be hurried down this impetuous Torrent, and concluded as the reſt to come to a Battle.</p>
                  <p>It was then in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> that the <hi>Christian</hi> Army, compoſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſeventy thouſand men, without computing thoſe who were aboard the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64918:170"/>Fleet,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1221</label> which conſiſted in a great number of Veſſels, marched directly againſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> towards <hi>Caire,</hi> which is about thirty Leagues from <hi>Damiata.</hi> They marched between the two Eaſtern Branches of the <hi>Nile,</hi> the Fleet being upon their right hand, which ſailed up the <hi>Tanitique</hi> Arm, to furniſh them with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and if there were occaſion to combate the Veſſels of the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all the Enemies which were in the Field fled and retired to the main Body of the <hi>Saraſin</hi> Army on the other ſide the River; and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> taking this flight for a happy preſage of their Victory, marched pleaſantly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as far as the half-way towards <hi>Caire,</hi> to the Angle which theſe two Arms of the <hi>Nile</hi> make, where they muſt of neceſſity ſtop, by reaſon that the Enemy was incamped on the other ſide the River, and which was extremely difficult and dangerous to paſs in view of an Army more numerous than theirs. Now though the Sultan ſaw his Deſign begin to thrive ſo well, he having drawn the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the place which he deſired, yet nevertheleſs ſeeing them in ſo good a condition, and that they were much ſtronger than he had believed, he was afraid that they would at laſt, in deſpight of all his Art and Force, find ſome way to paſs the River; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> having more than once before this done the ſame in the ſight of ſtronger Armies than his: For this reaſon therefore, having no mind to be conſtrained to expoſe his Empire to the hazard of a Battle, which he was afraid he might loſe, he choſe rather once more to offer Peace upon the ſame conditions which he had before propoſed; adding moreover this time that he would leave them in the peaceable poſſeſſion of <hi>Damiata,</hi> with its Territories for above ſix Leagues round about it, provided that they paſſed no farther.</p>
                  <p>And in truth this was all that which the <hi>Cruſades</hi> could reaſonably have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or wiſhed for; nor was it poſſible to make a Peace either more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or more advantageous to all Chriſtendom; ſince thereby they would moſt aſſuredly recover the whole Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for which only the War was undertaken, without the Expence of one drop of Chriſtian Blood: But it hath been an obſervation of more than one Ages Experience, that when a Perſon, who is not acquainted with the Myſtery and Profeſſion of War, takes a Fancy in his imagination to the honour of that Employ, and believes that he ought to do ſome wonderful action to render himſelf illuſtrious and conſiderable by his Arms; there is nothing which he will not do to ſatisfie that fooliſh paſſion, which uſually carries him further than his Fear, the common and natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe people, who become courageous and reſolute when they think their Enemies timerous and cowardly. The Legate, who had once before rejected the Propoſitions of Peace, was now ſo far from hearkning to them, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this offer of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s, as an indubitable ſign, that he was in his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion deſperate, and gave all for loſt, unleſs he could weather this dreadful Tempeſt which hung over his head, he preſſed the Commanders now more vigorouſly than ever, to come to the deciſion of a general Battle.</p>
                  <p>This Legate was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by birth, and by profeſſion a Benedictine Monk, a man of Spirit and great Abilities, but of a Nature extremely fierce, and ſo mightily Opinionatretive, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, who had made him Cardinal, had at one time thoughts of depriving him of that Dignity, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf ſingly and pertinaciouſly againſt a <hi>Bulla,</hi> which the whole Sacred College had ſigned in favour of the <hi>Cistercian</hi> Monks. But that which at this time rendered him more conceited and obſtinate in his own Opinion, was that he had the weakneſs too common in all times to abundance of people, which made him give ſtrange credit to certain Predictions, which ſtill diſcovered his Vanity and Folly, and with which he continually permitted himſelf to be abuſed. For having heard it ſaid in his Country, that there was an old Prophecy which gave aſſurance, that at that time there ſhould a man go out of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſhould ruin and overthrow the Sect and Empire of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Eaſt. He had an imagination that he might be that glorious man, who was deſigned by the Oracle for that mighty Action, and conſequently that he ought to attempt all things to finiſh that admirable Adventure. And this ridiculous Fancy was the reaſon, that, by obſtinately refuſing the Peace which the <hi>Sultan</hi> offered upon conditions ſo advantageous to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whileſt he coveted all, he loſt all. So much

                  <p>The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who then perceived that he had to do with people whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption had ſo far blinded them, that they never once perceived the danger into which by an extreme imprudence they had thrown themſelves, now had no other thoughts, but how to oppoſe their paſſage with all his Forces, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of executing the deſign which he had formed of deſtroying the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, without ever drawing his Sword. And in truth he guarded the other Bank of the <hi>Nile</hi> ſo well, as it was eaſie for him to do with thoſe innumerable Troops, which he had diſpoſed in all places where there was any poſſbility of landing, that they could never come to lay a Bridge, ſo that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtay between the two Chanals of that great River near a Month, waſting the time in little Combats and Skirmiſhes, with their Arrows croſs the River; and in this time the Army was leſſened by ten thouſand men, who weary of this ſlow and fooliſh way of fighting, or doubting what would be the Event, and fearing that which happened, retired in good time to <hi>Damiata.</hi> For the <hi>Nile,</hi> which at this time continually increaſes, being now riſen to that height which the <hi>Sultan</hi> expected, he cauſed the Sluces to be opened, and filled all the great Canals, which croſs all the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the Weſtern Arm of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which anciently was called <hi>Canopus,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Roſſetta,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to the <hi>Peluſian</hi> Branch; and having filled theſe Canals, he brought his Ships in, which paſſing over to the <hi>Tanitique</hi> below <hi>Damiata,</hi> ſurprized the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, which expected nothing leſs, for they did not believe they could come thither but by the <hi>Tanitique</hi> Chanal, and by <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> which ſhut up that paſſage; and in this ſurpriſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Guard, the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were for the purpoſe provided of ſtore of <hi>Greek</hi> wild-fire, ſet the Ships on fire at their pleaſure, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being unfurniſhed of Materials to extinguiſh it, the greateſt part of the Ships were burnt, and they hindred the reſt without any difficulty, from carrying Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Army.</p>
                  <p>The Commanders finding now too late, that it was impoſſible for them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long to ſubſiſt there, or to paſs further, thought of retreating towards <hi>Damiata,</hi> marching at a good diſtance from the River, and the Enemies Fleet, which they kept upon their left hand; but they had marched but a little way, when the <hi>Sultan</hi> cauſing the other Sluces to be opened, all the little Ditches, which croſs the Fields were preſently filled, and the water continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, all the Country was ſo drowned in a few hours, that the whole Army found themſelves under an inevitable danger of periſhing; inſomuch that they were forced to do that which nothing but extream neceſſity could excuſe, by conſtraining them to accept what <hi>Meledin</hi> by a moſt ſurprizing adventure, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them at the ſame time to draw them out of that terrible danger, to which they were reduced. For whether it were that this <hi>Sultan,</hi> who naturally had abundance of humanity, could not ſee ſo many Princes and Lords of the higheſt Quality periſh in this miſerable manner; or that God, who diſpoſeth abſolutely of all hearts, did upon this occaſion mollifie that of this <hi>Egyptian,</hi> to ſave this poor Army; or at laſt that this Prince, who was Wiſe and Politick, choſe rather preſently to draw <hi>Damiata</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than to put it to the hazard not to take it at all, though this Army ſhould be loſt; it is certain that he offered them a Truce for eight years, which was inſtantly accepted, upon condition that <hi>Damiata</hi> ſhould be preſently ſurrendred to him, and that he ſhould reciprocally reſtore the true Croſs, which had been taken by his Uncle <hi>Saladin;</hi> and that all the Priſoners, which had been taken on both ſides, as well in <hi>Egypt</hi> as in <hi>Syria,</hi> ſhould be ſet at liberty. Thoſe who were in Garriſon at <hi>Damiata</hi> made ſome difficulty of ſurrendring the place; but as on the one part they were not provided to maintain a long Siege, and that on the other the <hi>Sultan</hi> that he might be ſecure of it, would have the King himſelf, the Legate, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> for Hoſtages, there was a neceſſity of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; ſo that the Treaty was with great ſidelity performed on both ſides, and <hi>Meledin</hi> himſelf did ſuch things as could not be reaſonably expected
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64918:171"/>from a <hi>Saraſin,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1221</label> and which at this time would be thought no diſhonour to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince to do them. For after he had cauſed the Sluces to be ſhut up, and the water to be let out to leave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a free paſſage, he alſo furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with plenty of Proviſions for five dayes, and upon the rendition of <hi>Damiata</hi> the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> he ſent his Son to attend the King and Princes, and to furniſh them magnificently with whatever was neceſſary for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn either by Sea or Land into <hi>Phoenicia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the unhappy Effect which was produced by that Diviſion, which always continued during the whole War, between the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Legate <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who aſſuredly had done much better, if according to his Profeſſion, and the Intention of him from whom he was ſent, he had not gone beyond his Commiſſion, but had applied himſelf wholly to maintain a perfect Union among the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and to exhort them to do bravely; leaving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the War to the King, whom God hath ordained to carry the Sword, and to make uſe of it upon occaſion as he ſhall judge moſt expedient. But that which was ſtill moſt deplorable, was that this loſs of <hi>Damiata,</hi> was the thing which begot that ſad difference between the Emperour and the Holy See, which beginning under Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> upon the miſcarriage of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> had thoſe dreadful conſequences under the two following Popes, which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an infinite number of miſchiefs to the Church, and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and were at laſt the principal cauſe of the ruine of the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Eaſt. But in regard, that it is in this part of Hiſtory where the Writers obſerve the worſt meaſures, and for the moſt part on the one ſide and the other fall into the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and Declamation, which a Hiſtorian ought above all things to avoid, as the moſt dangerous to his honour, and the credit which he deſires to have in the World, I have, therefore, indeavoured to ſecure my ſelf from that prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which by reaſon of my profeſſion may render me ſuſpected of partiality; and have reſolved faithfully and impartially to relate matters of fact, as I find them in the moſt Authentick Acts and Records, and in thoſe Authors leaſt liable to Suſpicion or Exception, without undertaking to paſs my Cenſure and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of the Intentions of People, which only appertains to God; or of the right, which they either had, or had not to do as they then did; leaving this wholly to the pleaſure and diſcretion of the Reader, whom it is neceſſary that I ſhould firſt make acquainted with this ſame Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of whom there are ſuch different paintings and Portraicts drawn by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>He was then of the Age of near eight and twenty years, of a juſt Stature and majeſtick Shape, a good Proportion, and a Complexion ſtrong and vigorous; his Face was very agreeable, his Hair fair, inclining ſomething to yellow, and in the turn of his Mouth, his Forehead, his Eyes, and his whole Face, there was a certain briskneſs, fine and ſprightly, which produced in thoſe who ſaw him, at the ſame time both Love and Veneration. As for his Mind, one may truly ſay that he had there a ſtrange Medley of the admirable good Qualities of his Grandfather, and the ill ones of his Father; for like him he was of temper, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vindicative in the purſuit of his Enemies, ſevere and vigorous in taking his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge even to cruelty; not too religious or exact in obſerving his Promiſes, nor overburdened with true Piety or Devotion: he was cunning, dexterous, and a notable Diſſembler, commonly preferring his Intereſt before his Conſcience; and above all, an exceſſive lover of the pleaſures and delights of Sence, in which he would drown himſelf ſometimes, even to Scandal and Infamy. But on the other part, it muſt not be concealed or denied, but that he was Maſter of many moſt admirable Qualities and Perfections worthy of a Great Prince, even by the confeſſion of his very Enemies. For he had a Heart truly Great and Noble, he was moſt Liberal and Magnificent, and above all things never failed in plentifully rewarding the Services which were done for him; he was Prudent and Mighty knowing in Affairs of State, and of ſtrong natural Parts and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; really brave, and a moſt excellent Soldier, perfectly a Maſter in the Trade of War; He had a Mind very quick, apprehenſive, and generally knowing, and which being ſtored with a large ſtock of acquired Learning, rendered him very able in moſt of the Liberal Arts, but more particularly in Mechanicks, which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64918:171"/>he knew even to perfection; and that which was ſtill more rare,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1221</label> he ſpoke ſix ſeveral Languages ſo well, that in any one of them he was able to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with eaſe and Eloquence, either in the <hi>Latin, Greek, Italian, French, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or <hi>Saraſin;</hi> he was a great admirer and lover of Learning, and learned men, for whoſe ſake he cauſed an exact <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation of the Works of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be made from the beſt Copies, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabian,</hi> of which he made a Preſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Bologne.</hi> Such in truth was this Prince, of whom Authors write ſo differently; the various paſſions, with which they are poſſeſſed, too frequently tranſporting them with immoderate and unbecoming heat in favour of the ſeveral Parties and Intereſts which they follow, making ſome of them conceal his Vices, and ſpeak of nothing but his Perfections, whileſt others overlooking all his good Qualities, will permit the Reader to ſee only with their Opticks his Vices and his Faults.</p>
                  <p>Now the Emperor having underſtood in <hi>Pavia,</hi> where he then was, the ſad news of the loſs of <hi>Damiata,</hi> which was brought him from the Eaſt by the Great Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, he ſent immediately to the Pope, to let him know how great an Affliction this misfortune of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was unto him, and to aſſure him that he would omit nothing, which in the preſent condition of his Affairs was poſſible for him to do, to put himſelf as ſoon as could be into a condition of going in Perſon with a powerful Army into <hi>Syria.</hi> But the Pope, who was ſtrucken with this News, as if it had been a Thunderbolt, and whoſe Grief admitted of no Conſolation, vented his Paſſion by writing to him in very hard Language, bitterly complaining of him, and accuſing him of being the occaſion of this Diſaſter, in ſo often abuſing his good Nature, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Voyage from time to time, notwithſtanding that he ſtood obliged to the performance of it, both by his Oath and Vow; laying to his charge the guilt of this great blow which Chriſtendom had received by the deplorable loſs in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And after having exhorted him to repair this fault by immediately conducting into <hi>Syria</hi> the Aſſiſtance which he had ſo often promiſed, proteſting that if he did not do it without any longer amuſing the World by his Excuſes and Delaies, he would declare him, and cauſe him to be ſolemnly denounced, to his confuſion, an Excommunicate Perſon throughout the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, as a Sacrilegious Violater of the Vow which he had made unto Almighty God.</p>

                     <hi>Frederick,</hi> who believed that the Gallies of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Army of <hi>Germany,</hi> which he had ſent to <hi>Damiata;</hi> but above all the Importance of the War, which he was obliged to attend in <hi>Sicily,</hi> were ſufficient Excuſes for him, was extreamly provoked by theſe Letters and theſe Menaces. And being of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Nature when he was ſhocked, and the good Fortune, which hitherto in all his Enterpriſes had attended him, rendring him more fierce and haughty, he openly broke with the Pope, entred upon the Lands of the Church, which he ſaid belonged to the Empire; he chaſed ſeveral Biſhops out of the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> who were ſuſpected to favour the Pope, and of his own Authority named others, renewing the Ancient Pretenſions of the Kings of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> who affirmed that this Right appertained to them; and to juſtifie his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings he made a long Deduction in his Manifeſt, how many and great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he had of Complaint for the Injuſtices, which he ſaid were done him by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> his Guardian during his Minority, in ſeizing upon, and uſurping his Regalities and Rights; and even by <hi>Honorius</hi> alſo, whom he accuſed to have, contrary to all Juſtice, exacted many things of him, which he was conſtrained to yield ſo much againſt his will, that ſo he might receive from him the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown, which he could not in Juſtice have diſpenced with himſelf in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to place it upon the Head of an Emperour ſo lawfully Elected, and who had two ſeveral times before been Crowned.</p>
                  <p>The Pope, who was very prudent, and of a temper very ſoft and ſweet, was reſolved not to carry matters to Extremity; and therefore he anſwered to theſe Complaints, that he was a Father; and that his Son though he were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and undutiful, yet was not therefore either a Stranger or an Enemy, ſo long as there was any hope that he might return to his Duty. He therefore ſatisfied himſelf to anſwer to the Complaints and Reproaches of <hi>Frederick</hi> with abundance of mildneſs, in a long Letter, which to ſpeak properly, was a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64918:172"/>or Apology for the Conduct of his Predeceſſors and his own,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1222</label> in reference to this Prince. He exhorted him alſo by other Letters, full of Tenderneſs and Reaſon, ſeriouſly to recollect himſelf, and to conſider, that as he was Emperor, he was the Protector of the Church, and that therefore he ought not to oppreſs her, or take away her Liberties; but to take pity of Chriſtianity in the Eaſt, which held up her ſuppliant hands to him, from whom only ſhe had hopes of being aſſiſted. But whether <hi>Frederick</hi> was moved by theſe Remonſtrances of the Pope; or whether he feared the dangerous conſequences of this Rupture, particularly in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where they began to form a great League againſt him, it is certain that this procedure ſweetned both Parties, and that the Emperor ſatisfied the Pope, taking all his Dominions into his Protection, and that the Pope during all his Pontificate, never proceeded further than theſe Menaces and Anathema's, as may be ſeen plainly by the Letters of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and that after this, they both acted by Agreement for the Succour of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>They had firſt a meeting at <hi>Veroli,</hi> between the Cities of <hi>Anagnia</hi> and <hi>Sora,</hi> where after a Conſultation of five Dayes with the Cardinals, they ordained that there ſhould be another Conference, to which were to be invited King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> the Legate <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the Patriarch, and the Great Maſters of the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> who were better able than any others to give them ſuch an underſtanding of theſe Affairs, as might enable them to come to the laſt Reſolution upon them. After which the Emperor ſent four Gallies to bring them over, and upon their arrival this famous Conference was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be held in <hi>Champagne</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> the year following. There it was that to ingage <hi>Frederick</hi> more ſtrongly than ever to undertake this Holy War,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1223</label> it was agreed by common conſent, that this Prince, who had in the preceeding year loſt the Empreſs <hi>Conſtantia</hi> his Wife, the Daughter of the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> ſhould marry the Princeſs <hi>Jolante,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> the Heireſs of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Conqueſt whereof it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he would take more Intereſt than before, when it ſhould be his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for which he was to ſight. It was alſo ordained, that in two Years he ſhould part with all the Forces of the Empire at Midſummer, to which thoſe that were preſent, and Parties obliged themſelves by a Solemn Oath, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould fail in the performance of his Promiſe, ſhould be Excommunicate. After which the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> parted, every one to indeavour for his part, according to his power, to diſpoſe all things for this Holy War, which was to be begun two Years after.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who was able to do nothing more in <hi>Europe,</hi> but to ſollicite the Princes to contribute their part to this War, went to deſire the Aſſiſtance of <hi>England, Spain, Germany,</hi> and above all in <hi>France,</hi> where he arrived a little before the Death of <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, his Benefactor and Protector. This great Prince, who had laboured under a Quartan Ague for above a Year, and who nevertheleſs did not ceaſe to viſit his Provinces, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to carry himſelf as a Great King, with all the ſtrength imaginable of a Soul, which did not ſeem to be concerned at the weakneſs of the Body, died this Year at the Caſtle of <hi>Mante,</hi> the fourteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> in the eight and fiftieth Year of his Age, and the three and thirtieth of his Reign, which by the Glory of his Actions, by his Heroick Qualities, by his Power, and by the Force of his Arms, he had rendred the moſt flouriſhing of all that <hi>France</hi> had ever ſeen ſince that of <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> And as he had worn the Croſs in the third <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade,</hi> which was famous for the remarkable winning of the City of <hi>Ptolemais;</hi> ſo he gave in his Will a Noble Teſtimony of the Zeal which he ſtill preſerved for the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and for the Deliverance of his Holy Sepulchre. For among other Magnificent Effects of his pious Liberality, which are therein to be obſerved, for the comfort and relief of the Poor, for the Deliverance and Ranſom of the Wife of <hi>Amauri,</hi> Count <hi>de Montfort,</hi> who was a Priſoner amongſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and for other Works of Chriſtian Piety, he bequeathed three hundred thouſand Livres for the Relief of the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> and ſo much to each of the two great Maſters of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> nor was his going of the Theater of the World

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1226</label> than by all the magnificent Teſtimonies of rejoycing, upon this occaſion. But the ſatisfaction, which <hi>John de Brienne</hi> received from this Marriage, which was of his own procuring, and which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as his principal ſupport, did not continue long. For <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was reſolved to have the preſent enjoyment of what he deſired, and could not perſwade his hope to live upon the ſpare diet of future incertainty, told his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, that he was abſolutely reſolved from that moment, to have the Soveraignty, the Rights, the Titles and the Demeſnes of the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which appertained to him, as the Dowry of the Empreſs his Wife, and that he would not permit any other to enjoy them. This Poor Prince to whom the Great Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, had promiſed upon the Treaty of this Marriage, that he ſhould during his life enjoy the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſtrangely ſurprized at this diſcourſe, which he had ſo little expected. But as he was not in a condition to oppoſe the Will of an Emperor, who was reſolved to make himſelf be obeyed, and moreover that the diſobliging manner, with which he was treated, made him ſenſible that the Emperor was highly incenſed againſt him, there was a neceſſity that he ſhould ſtrip himſelf of all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all his Rights and pretenſions to that Realm to yield it to <hi>Frederick;</hi> and ever ſince that time the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> have added in their bearing the Croſs of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to their other Arms.</p>
                  <p>It had like alſo to have happened, that the Emperor, not contented to have diſpoiled him of his Kingdom, failed but little of taking his life alſo, as well as that of his Nephew <hi>Gautier,</hi> Count <hi>de Champagne,</hi> the Son of him who had done ſuch gallant actions in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> For ſome People having put it into the Emperors head, that this Count, who was the Son of the Daughter of <hi>Tancred,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> pretended a Right to that Kingdom, and that his Uncle ſecretly encouraged and aſſiſted him in caballing and making a ſtrong Party to ſeize upon it, this ſuſpicion had like to have coſt them both their lives; for there is nothing, which makes Princes ſo eaſily dip their hands in Blood as Jealouſie of State, a diſeaſe, which, when once it gets the Poſſeſſion of the minds of Great men, drives them to the moſt outrageous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, ſo that it hath been often ſeen, that neither the Fathers have ſpared their Children, nor Children their Parents, when the Jealouſie hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Crowns and Scepters. The Uncle and the Nephew therefore to ſecure themſelves, not truſting to the good Intervals of an humour, which rarely is able wholly to overcome even the moſt groundleſs ſuſpicious, thought beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire out of the reach of danger, the Count into his Earldom of <hi>Brienne</hi> in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> and King <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he put himſelf under the Protection of the Pope, who had a wonderful eſteem for this Prince, and who to no purpoſe did what he could by his Remonſtrances, and by his intreaties, to oblige <hi>Frederick</hi> to reſtore the Crown of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to him for his Life; but not being able to prevail, that he might in ſome manner comfort him for his diſgrace, he made him Governour of the greateſt part of the Eccleſiaſtick Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>But although this diſcreet Pope, had no great reaſon to be ſatisfied, with a proceeding of the Emperor ſo little obliging; nevertheleſs as he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as to quiet all thoſe diſcords and Wars, which might be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to that, which he ſo much deſired, ſhould be made againſt the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Church, he did not forbear doing what was moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for the Emperors Intereſt, inſomuch that he perſwaded the greateſt part of the Cities of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> who were confederated againſt him, to lay down their Arms; and obliged himſelf to obtain their Peace and pardon, with the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Privileges, and Immunities, upon condition that they ſhould at their own charge, maintain a certain number of Soldiers to ſerve under the Emperor for two years, in the <hi>Holy War.</hi> It was for the ſame reaſon that he hindred <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> from Enterprizing any thing againſt <hi>France,</hi> whileſt <hi>Lewis</hi> the eighth made War againſt the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> That King proſecuted the War againſt them with ſo much heat and Zeal, that he did not ſpare continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to expoſe his Royal Perſon to all hazards and dangers; and after having taken <hi>Avignion,</hi> and the greateſt part of the conſiderable places in <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:64918:173"/>he was ſeized with that dangerous Malady, which was got into his Army,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1226</label> of which he died at <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> the eight of <hi>November</hi> in the fourtieth Year of his Age, and the third of his Reign, leaving for his Succeſſor his eldeſt Son, <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth, of the Age of twelve years, under the Regence of the Queen his Mother, <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> This was he who by the Auguſt Sirname of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Saint, which was given him by God, by the Authority which he hath given to his Church, hath made himſelf be more gloriouſly diſtinguiſhed by that title ſince his death, than all other Kings have done during their lives, by all the moſt Illuſtrious Sirnames and moſt magnificent appellations, which men have beſtowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the term drawing near, wherein the Emperor had obliged himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Voyage, and that all things appeared better diſpoſed than ever they had been before to the undertaking, the Pope believed that the deciding Blow, which he had ſo long deſired, was now certainly to be given: And therefore redoubling his Efforts, as one ſhall ſee a Flambeau blaze out twice or thrice with mighty Force before it is extinguiſhed, ſo he preſſed the <hi>Cruſades</hi> with ſo much Ardour, that an infinite number of them came from all <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> it is reported that out of <hi>England</hi> alone there came above ſixty thouſand men, to whom the appearance of a marvellous Crucifix from Heaven all glorious and ſhining, in which were plainly to be ſeen the five Wounds, had given ſo much Courage, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing ſo much as to combat and to die for Jeſus Chriſt. But as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Pope believed that he ſhould enjoy upon Earth the Fruit of ſo much care and pains as he had taken to aſſemble ſo many <hi>Cruſades,</hi> he was taken more happily for himſelf to receive them in Heaven; from whence he might ſee, though without trouble, in a ſmall time after, that which would have ſufficiently afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in this life, that the Succeſs of this <hi>Cruſade</hi> proved quite otherways than he had vainly flattered himſelf withal in the time of his Pontificate. But that a man may therefore never be diſappointed, there is nothing better than for any Perſon conſtantly to do what he ought to do, and what he can do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out promiſing himſelf any certainty of future contingencies and Events, for which God alone is able to anſwer.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1227</label> He died at <hi>Rome</hi> the ſixth of <hi>March</hi> in the Year 1227; and two days after the Sacred College by common conſent, gave him for his Succeſſor, the famous <hi>Hugoline</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> who took the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth. He was Nephew to <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who had imployed him in the moſt important Affairs of the Church; a man of a mighty Spirit, well made, and of a Port ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Majeſtick, very knowing, a great Canoniſt, and of an irreproachable Life, to whom St. <hi>Francis,</hi> whoſe order he took into his Protection, had predicted that he ſhould be Pope. He was in ſhort of great Courage, and incapable of yielding even in the greateſt dangers, but withal too quick in Execution of what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without fearing the Conſequences how miſcheivous ſoever they might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be. The firſt thing that he did after his Exaltation, was to purſue the Enterpriſe of his Predeceſſor, and to preſs the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ſoon as it was poſſible into a Condition to perform what he had ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed. This Prince, who after ſo many delays, durſt no longer deſire the time to be prolonged, appointed the <hi>Rendevouz</hi> to be at <hi>Brindes,</hi> where the Shipping lay all ready for the Tranſportation of that Infinite number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who deſcended from all parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> But as they came into <hi>Pavia,</hi> during the great heats of the Summer, which in that Country are exceſſive, an Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſtemper began to diſperſe it ſelf among them, which took off a great number, and made others withdraw themſelves, though few of them ever returned into their own Country, but periſhed miſerably by the Way.</p>
                  <p>That which further contributed to the diminution of the Army, was, that a certain Impoſture, ſet up by ſome of the Principal Perſons in <hi>Rome,</hi> who had no kindneſs for the Pope, as it appeared preſently after, counterfeited an Authority and Power from <hi>Gregory,</hi> who had appointed him his Vicar, for that purpoſe, to take of the Croſs from ſuch as deſired to be diſpenſed with, as to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Voyage, and to commute their Vow into ſome conſiderable Alms, of which this Cheat made his own advantage. It is true that he was taken by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64918:174"/>of the Pope,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1227</label> and paid the price of his impoſture; but it was not till after many, who were very glad to be diſpenſed with from a Voyage, which they found already to be troubleſome and dangerous, had quitted the Croſs by this Way, which they believed was a very lawful and authentick way of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded. In ſhort, thoſe who remained into <hi>Pavia</hi> came to <hi>Brindes,</hi> with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and <hi>Lewis,</hi> Lantgrave of <hi>Thuringia</hi> and <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who had conducted a gallant Troop of <hi>Germans,</hi> who were imbarked about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſailed towards <hi>Syria,</hi> not doubting but they ſhould be followed by the Emperor, who ſeemed continually diſpoſed and ready to part thither alſo.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly ſo ſoon as he ſaw the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> a little recovered of ſome Fits of a Fever, which he had gotten in a little Iſland near <hi>Brindes,</hi> whether he had gone to divert himſelf, he put to Sea the eight of <hi>September</hi> with this Prince and the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe few Troops which remained. But he ſailed not far, for the third day of the Navigation, he commanded them of a ſudden to tack about, and ſtand for the Port of <hi>Otranto,</hi> alledging that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much indiſpoſed, and that in the Condition wherein he was, he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly brook the Sea. But this little Voyage was very unfortunate to the poor <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> for the Fever redoubling upon him, he died in a few days after, receiving the Sacrament from the hands of the Patriarch with great Piety and Devotion. He was a Prince of an extraordinary merit, and had ſo well profited by the Admirable Example of his Wiſe St. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Andrew,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to whom he did not yield in Sanctity; and it is ſaid that it pleaſed God to make his Piety more reſplendent after his death by diverſe Miracles, which were done at his Tomb. I cannot affirm poſitively what effect the death of this Prince had upon the Soul of <hi>Frederick;</hi> or whether he believed, that it furniſhed him with a ſpecious Pretext to break of his Voyage; but it is certain that after this he thought no more of departing; but continually pretended that his Malady was the Obſtacle to it; inſomuch that near forty thouſand <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were gone before him, hearing this news they alſo ſuddenly returned to <hi>Brindes,</hi> and from thence into their reſpective Countries.</p>
                  <p>Now the Pope, who was then at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> being informed in what manner the Emperor, after having begun the Voyage, had broken it off, he was ſeized with an exceſſive Grief, ſeing all the hopes, which he had of the happy Succeſs of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> vaniſhed in a moment. He had no Conſideration of what was alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged concerning the Indiſpoſition of the Emperor; he believed that it was all a Fiction, and nothing but a falſe pretext, which this Prince made, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Oaths, had no Inclination to accompliſh his Vow, thereby to elude the Puniſhments both of God and man. And therefore without deferring any longer, and without having recourſe to Menaces, or ſo much as giving him any notice of it, or giving him longer time as had been done before, he went in his Pontifical Robes, accompanied with the Cardinals and the Prelates, the nine and twentieth day of <hi>September,</hi> being St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s day, to the great Church, where he ſolemnly declared him excommunicate, according to the Sentence to which he himſelf had voluntarily ſubmitted before the two Legates of the late deceaſed Pope. At the ſame time he writ to the Princes, and Biſhops through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> his circular Letters, wherein he ſhewed the reaſons which had obliged him to have recourſe to this ſevere Method, which was the Crimes, the Perjuries and the Artifices of the Emperor; and eſpecially, <hi>That having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in readineſs for the tranſportation of the</hi> Cruſades <hi>at the time prefixed, that he had with a formed deſign of miſcheif stopped them, that ſo the greateſt part of the Army might periſh by the Intemperance of the Air, during the exceſſive heats of the year as accordingly it had unfortunately happened.</hi> And in ſhort, he ſaid, <hi>that this Prince nevertheleſs having not the Power to ſtop them all, but that in deſpight of his deteſtable Arts, there ſtill remained a great number, who having ſet ſail for</hi> Syria, <hi>he had baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandoned them, under the pretence of a feigned Sickneſs, by the moſt abominable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, that ſo he might return into his Realm and there plunge himſelf in his ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Debauches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, <hi>Frederick</hi> furiouſly incenſed againſt the Pope, and reſolving, being as he was, Potent and Vindicative, to carry matters to the utmoſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64918:174"/>of Revenge, failed not alſo on his part to ſend to all the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1227</label> and to all the Princes of the Empire, his Manifeſt in anſwer to the Pope's Letters, wherein, <hi>After having proteſted, that the preſſing Affairs of his Eſtate, and the War, which he was conſtrained to make againſt his Rebels, had obliged him to deſire thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longations of time from the Pope, which could not with any manner of Juſtice be denyed him; That he took God to Witneſs, that it was no feigned but a real Indiſpoſition of Body, which hindred him from purſuing that Holy Voyage, which he had begun with a moſt real Intention of performing it; and that in deſpight of the Injuſtice, which was done him, he was reſolved ſo ſoon as he was in a Condition for it, to undertake it anew. And then inlarging himſelf in ſharp Invectives, againſt the abuſes and the Crimes, whereof he accuſed the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>he did what he could to intereſt all Crowned heads in that which he ſaid was their ſeveral and particular concern; and to perſwade them to unite with him, to oppoſe thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, which were deſigned against them and their temporal Rights which they held only and immediately from God alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters, which on both ſides were with great diligence diſpatched to all places, produced the Effects, which are uſual in ſuch quarrels as happen between Great men, which is to divide into parties the People and the Writers of thoſe times; ſome declaring themſelves for the Pope, others for the Emperor, and both the one and the other, accuſing their adverſe Party of Calumnies and Impoſtures. But the Emperor, who was reſolved to make uſe of other Arms beſides Invectives, that he might make his Vengeance the more remarkable, inſtead of ſeeking for the Favour of abſolution as the Pope by his Letters invited him to do, found means to chaſe the Pope from <hi>Rome.</hi> For having got to him the <hi>Frangepanis,</hi>

For he bought all their Lands for ready Money, which he preſently ſurrendred to them again to be held of him in Fee, by making them take an Oath to do him true and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Service, and to obey all his Orders without exception; ſo that upon their return to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope having upon Holy Thurſday anew excommunicated the Emperor, they raiſed againſt him ſuch a horrible Sedition among the People, who in thoſe times did not love the Domination of the Popes, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to quit <hi>Rome,</hi> and for his Security to retire to <hi>Peruſa.</hi> In the mean time the Emperor, who omitted nothing to ſatiate his Revenge, terribly proſecuted the Eccleſiaſticks, whom he believed to adhere to the Pope, ravaging their Lands, and the Patrimony of the Church by the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> whom he had tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Sicily</hi> into <hi>Pavia,</hi> pillaging and Sacking the Houſes of the <hi>Templers,</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> whom he held for Enemies; and by his Lieutenants making a moſt cruel War in the Duchies of <hi>Spoleta</hi> and <hi>Beneventum,</hi> and in the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona,</hi> from whence King <hi>John de Brienne,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory</hi> ſet to oppoſe him as his particular Enemy, repulſed his Troops, being ſpeedily aſſiſted by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Succour from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who upon this occaſion manifeſted a very great Zeal for the Service of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe Hoſtilities did not at laſt hinder <hi>Frederick</hi> from taking the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to undertake the Voyage into <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> to which he found himſelf obliged by many reaſons. For that it might appear that the Sickneſs which he had made uſe of for the Excuſe of his delay, was not feigned, he had engaged his Word to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that ſo ſoon as his health would permit him he would paſs into <hi>Syria,</hi> and that being now very well eſtabliſhed, there was a neceſſity that he ſhould make good his Promiſe, leſt otherwiſe he might incurr the disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and ill opinion of ſo many great Princes, as he ſhould thereby delude. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to whom he had given two Gallies at <hi>Otranto,</hi> and all the other Commanders of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were already paſſed into <hi>Syria</hi> had writ the moſt preſſing Letters to the Pope, which he ſent all over <hi>Europe</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all Faithful People to go to the relief of their Chriſtian Brethren in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Frederick</hi> was afraid leſt <hi>John de Brienne</hi> ſhould put himſelf at the head of thoſe, who would go and recover the Kingdom of which he had deſpoiled him. And in ſhort the Empreſs <hi>Jolante,</hi> who died after her Lying-in, had left him a Son called <hi>Conrade,</hi> who aſſuring the Crown of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to his Houſe, well deſerved

                  </p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe having aſſembled all the Great men of his Realm at <hi>Barletta,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> who had followed him into <hi>Italy</hi> he aſcended a Throne, which he had cauſed to be erected in the middle of a great field filled with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of People, who flocked from all parts to this new and magnificent Spectacle, and in this lofty manner he was reſolved to declare his intention, that ſo it might make the greater noiſe in the World, and perſuade the whole Earth, that he looked upon this Enterpriſe of the Conqueſt of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as an Affair which lay neareſt to his heart, and which he eſteemed of the greateſt Importance of all others. There he cauſed his laſt Will and Teſtament to be publickly read, in which he declared at large what was his deſire in caſe it pleaſed God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his life in this dangerous Voyage, and obliged all the <hi>Sicilian</hi> and <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Nobility, to promiſe with an Oath, that they would ſee it performed, unleſs they received another Written with his own hand. And this without doubt was capable of blinding abundance of People, and deſtroying the report, which ran currant, that whatever he had done hitherto was only perfect Pageantry to amuſe the World; and that notwithſtanding his repeated Vows, promiſes and oaths, he never had any real intention of putting himſelf at the head of the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades</hi> for the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after all this, it muſt be avowed, that the end did not at all correſpond with theſe ſpecious Beginnings. For leaving the greateſt part of his Forces with <hi>Renard</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoleta,</hi> whom he declared Vicegerent of the Empire, in <hi>Italy,</hi> and his Lieutenant General in the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> he gave him Order to continue the War, with the Pope; and in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he himſelf imbarked upon twenty Gallies with ſuch a retinue and an Army, as for the ſmallneſs of their number, were neither becoming the Majeſty of ſuch a potent Prince, nor proportionable to the Enterpriſe in which he was engaged: Inſomuch that the Pope, who had the greateſt Intereſt in this Affair, wherein the general good of the Church and the Honour of the Chriſtian Name was ſo nearly concerned, ſent a Prohibition to him, abſolutely forbidding him to concern himſelf with the <hi>Holy War;</hi> it being as he ſaid altogether inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a Prince, who was cut off from the Body of the Church by the <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſhould appear at the head of the Army of God againſt the Infidels; and beſides that he had nothing near the number either of ſhipping or of Soldiers, which by his Oath he was obliged to carry to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and that with that ſmall Fleet he went rather like a Pyrate than an Emperor. But <hi>Frederick</hi> the more inraged againſt <hi>Gregory</hi> for this Ambaſſage, whom he no longer now regarded but as his mortal Enemy, embarked himſelf and ſet ſail in the view of the Pope's envoyes, to whom he would not condeſcend to give any other anſwer than what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Sterns of his Gallies; And after having as he paſſed by, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to his own advantage, a difference in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he had with the Lord of <hi>Baruch,</hi> the Governour of the Young King <hi>Henry,</hi> he arrived proſperouſly at the Port of <hi>Acre,</hi> the Eve of the Nativity of our Lady.</p>
                  <p>The Patriarch accompanied with his Clergy and People came to meet him, and received him with all the Honors which were due to an Emperor, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proteſted to him with great Freedom, that it was not permitted him to communicate or treat with his Imperial Majeſty, till ſuch time as he ſhould have received Abſolution from the Pope, to whom he moſt humbly intreated him to apply himſelf above all things, and to obtain this Favour from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which God would never bleſs his deſigns; and this he repeated to him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times after upon occaſion. And this was the firſt cauſe of the rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Prince and the Patriarch, who afterwards writ Letters againſt him into <hi>Europe</hi> full of ſharpneſs and Injuries; And I muſt needs affirm that it hath not been poſſible for me to perſwade my ſelf to write my Hiſtory after ſuch Copies, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have done, upon the diſpoſition of one Witneſs, who appears ſo Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and tranſported with Anger; and which is an Injury, which the meaneſt Perſon in the World before any equitable Judge would have reaſon to complain of, and think himſelf unfairly dealt withal, if being accuſed in ſuch a manner, he

As for <hi>Frederick</hi> he did not ſhew much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment in this Rencontre, but after he had received the Complements of the Princes and Lords of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> he ſatisfied himſelf with proteſting to them, as he had ever done, that his Indiſpoſition was the only Cauſe, which had obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Voyage till that time; and that alſo the Sentence, which the Pope had pronounced againſt him, without giving him the hearing, and without informing himſelf in a judicial Way of the truth of his caſe, was therefore in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture null and void. After which he took an Account of the Affairs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which were then in this Condition.</p>
                  <p>After the Departure of the great number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who had quitted <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> the preceding year, upon the new retardment of the Emperor's Voyage, there were not then in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> remaining of the new comers, more than about eight hundred men at Arms, and ten thouſand Foot, beſides the Knights, which the Great Maſters of the three Orders had upon the place. All theſe <hi>Cruſades</hi> had choſen for their General, <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> who after a long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration with the Officers of the Army, the Patriarch and the Biſhops of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> and <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too weak to attack <hi>Coradin,</hi> they had imployed themſelves in the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fortification of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and ſome other little Maritim places, reſolving to do the ſame to <hi>Jaffa,</hi> in expectation of the Succours, which were to come from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> In this time <hi>Coradin</hi> died, leaving for his Succeſſor his Son <hi>Meleſel,</hi> of the Age of twelve years, under the Tutelage and Regency of the Emir <hi>Eſedinebec:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Sultans his Neighbours failed not to enterprize immediately againſt him; and this doubtleſs was of great advantage to the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were not only delivered from the moſt formidable of their Enemies, but ſaw them alſo engaged in Civil Wars. This was the State of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Affairs at the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Emperor, who was not able to prevent it, but that many of this ſmall number of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> believing that they had ſatisfied their Vow by a Years Service, returned by the Conveniency of paſſage, which they had that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</p>

Upon this, whether the Emperor believed that he could not with thoſe few Troops he had, undertake this War but to his diſhonour; or whether it was that the matter was ſo preconcerted betwixt him and the Sultan before his coming thither, as the common report went, although there is no manner of Foundation for it in Hiſtory; or which is moſt probable, that he had a great deſire to return with all Expedition into <hi>Italy;</hi> it is certain that he ſent Count <hi>Thomas</hi> his Confident, and <hi>Balian,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tyre,</hi> to <hi>Meledin,</hi> to whom, after they had in the Emperors name made magnificent preſents, they acquainted him, <hi>That it was not at all the deſire of their Maſter, that there ſhould be any thing betwixt them two, which might prevent their living in perfect Amitie; That</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <hi>who was the moſt potent Prince in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>was not come into the Eaſt to make new Conqueſts there, for that he was poſſeſſed of ſuch large Dominions in the Weſt, as were capable to ſatisfie the vaſteſt Ambition; That the great reaſon of his coming, was to viſit the Holy places, and to redemand the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which the</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>had conquered, and for ſo long a time poſſeſſed, and which appertained to his Son, in right of the Empreſs</hi> Jolante, <hi>his Mother, who was the Queen and the lawful Inhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of that Kingdom; That if he were ſatisfied in a demand ſo juſt and reaſonable, he was ready to return into</hi> Europe <hi>without drawing his Sword; and therefore deſired the Sultan, that by an unjuſt refuſal he would not be the occaſion of ſheding ſo much humane Blood which might be ſpared, there having been ſo much already miſerably ſpilt in ſo many cruel Battles, as had been already fought upon this quarrel.</hi>

But that nevertheleſs, if his Imperial Majeſty would pleaſe to ſend new Ambaſſadors to their Maſter, he would make ſuch reaſonable Propoſitions, as that he ſhould have cauſe to find himſelf very well ſatisfied.</hi> And thereupon they preſented the Emperor from him with a huge Elephant, ſeveral admirable Camels, and divers other rare Animals of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> And <hi>Frederick,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having magnificently treated them, and honoured them with Noble Preſents, ſent them back with his Ambaſſadors to treat with the Sultan.</p>
                  <p>That Prince, who was reſolved to come to his Ends, in the manner which he had formed in his own Imagination, did not preſently give them Audience, but only made them be informed that they muſt follow him to the City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> whither he marched with his Army, leaving that of the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> his Nephew, at <hi>Napoloſe.</hi> This procedure made the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> believe, that <hi>Meledin</hi> had a Deſign to affront him, and therefore having cauſed all the Captains to Aſſemble, he acquainted them, that according to the reſolution which they had taken, he thought it convenient to march with the Army to <hi>Jaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa,</hi> and to fortifie it, thereby to ſecure the paſſage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they all ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Orders, except the two great Maſters of the <hi>Templers</hi> and <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallers,</hi> who ſaid in plain terms, that the Pope, to whom they owed obedience, had forbidden them to obey an Excommunicate Prince, and that therefore if the Orders were iſſued out in his Name, they would not obey them.

                  <p>But on the other part, the Patriarch writ to the Pope, and to all Chriſtian People, long Letters, in which he complains bitterly of <hi>Frederick,</hi> whom he treats in ſuch a manner, as at the leaſt one muſt ſay, is very injurious; there he indeavours to lay open the Shame, the Diſhonour, and Illuſion of the Treaty, by which he maintains, that <hi>Frederick</hi> hath betrayed Chriſtianity; Firſt, becauſe it is moſt ſhameful to have the <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſhare the Holy City with the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> Secondly, becauſe the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> having never given his conſent to the Agreement, the Treaty ſignified juſt nothing; and in ſhort, that all thoſe places, which were in ſhew, yielded to the Emperor, were in reallity as much the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> as they were before, ſince he returned into <hi>Europe</hi> without fortifying any one of them.

                  <p>In this time <hi>Baldwin,</hi> his Son-in-Law, and Succeſſor to the Empire, found the Pope ſo well inclined to aſſiſt him, that, as if he had now had no other concern, but for the Eſtabliſhment of the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he writ to the Kings of <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to all the Biſhops of thoſe Realms, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to contribute the utmoſt of their power, to the Aid of the Emperor, <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Second, even ſo far as to permit thoſe, who had undertaken the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> to change their Vow to that of ſuccouring <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He cauſed alſo a new <hi>Cruſade</hi> to be preached every where for that purpoſe, and that the greateſt part of the money, which was deſigned for the <hi>Holy Land</hi> ſhould be employed that way. Hereupon the Emperor <hi>Baldwin</hi> went into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence into <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Bulla</hi> of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and the Pope's Letters, which exhorted the <hi>Cruſades</hi> to follow him; ſo that he ſound a great many, who either to pleaſe the Pope, or that they thought this Enterpriſe leſs difficult and dangerous than that of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> preſently joyned with him, and among others, <hi>Peter de Dreux,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> who promiſed to aſſiſt him with twelve thouſand men.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1239</label> The Pope, who was in Poſſeſſion of the Sovereignty of this Iſle, ſtrangely ſurprized at this procedure, complained bitterly of it, and demanded repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>Frederick</hi> was ſo far from giving him Satisfaction, that he ſeized upon other Lands of a Biſhop of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which the Magiſtrates had adjudged as Demeſnes to the new King; and withal he made it be anſwered to the Pope for good and all, that <hi>Sardinia</hi> had been uſurped from the Emperors, and before thoſe Uſurpations, had always belonged to the Empire, and that for his own particular, it was well enough known, that as he was Emperor he had ſworn that he would do all that lay in his Power to reunite to the Body of the Empire whatſoever had been diſmembred from it, and that he was fully reſolved moſt exactly to acquit himſelf of his Duty in this particular. Hereupon the Pope ſeeing that he remained immoveable in that Reſolution, ſolemnly excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him upon Palm Sunday, and Holy Thurſday for invading the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, and ſuch other Cauſes as are comprized in the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which he pronounced himſelf, and which he ſent to all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings, Princes, and Prelates, with orders for them to publiſh it by the Sound of Bells, prohibiting all the Emperor's Subjects to obey him, and all the Eccleſiaſticks from celebrating the Divine Offices in the Cities or Caſtles, wherever he ſhould be. It is ſaid alſo, that having declared that he was fallen from the Imperial Title and Dignity, he offered the Crown to St. <hi>Lewis</hi> for his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> Count <hi>d' Artois,</hi> but that for very good reaſons that pious King rejected the Offer; and this is moſt certain, that by a moſt diſcreet Policy he would never concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this difference, nor be perſuaded to change the Conduct and Maximes of his Government, by taking Arms againſt the Emperor, although he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſollicited to do ſo by the Pope, as in the following year the King gave the Emperor an account by his Letters.</p>
                  <p>The War between the Pope and the Emperor began by the Writings, the Letters and the Manifeſts, which both the one and the other diperſed abroad, in which were contained the Accuſations and the Anſwers, which they made, which may be ſeen at their full length in <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> after which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Frederick</hi> having a potent Army, whileſt the Pope ſent to all places to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Aſſiſtance of the Princes and Republicks, cauſed his Son <hi>Entius</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona,</hi> whileſt he himſelf taking the Right Hand marched over <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where the greateſt part of the Cities, and even <hi>Viterbum</hi> receiving him and declaring againſt the Pope, he advanced directly towards <hi>Rome,</hi> not doubting but that he had ſuch a Party there, as would upon his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance open the Gates of that City to him. But <hi>Gregory,</hi> who in the extreme danger wherein he found himſelf, deſtitute of all humane Succours, had recourſe to God, by a great Proceſſion from the Church of the <hi>Lateran</hi> to that of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in which he did ſo movingly harangue the <hi>Romans,</hi> holding between his Arms the Venerable heads of the Apoſtles, proteſting with Sighs and Tears, that he was not in any ſort able to protect them without the Aſſiſtance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were their Protectors, that they cried out with an incredible Ardour, that they would all periſh in the defence of them. Hereupon the Pope, who was reſolved to make his advantage of this extraordinary Zeal of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whileſt the firſt heat of it laſted, cauſed a new <hi>Cruſade</hi> to be inſtantly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with great Indulgences to all thoſe, who would take up the Croſs againſt <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick;</hi> and his endeavours proved ſo effectual, that the ſame <hi>Romans,</hi> who before had been raiſed againſt him, and had driven him out of <hi>Rome</hi> in favour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, now took up the Croſs againſt him. So eaſily is the Spirit of the People turned from one Extremity to another, eſpecially when they are acted by ſome high Object of Devotion, and that Religion, or what they call ſo, which is able to do all things, when once it becomes Miſtreſs of their Souls ſeems to call them to the performance of what they think their Duty.</p>
                  <p>It happened therefore that <hi>Frederick</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he believed he ſhould enter without reſiſtance, was ſtrangely ſurprized to meet with a whole Army of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were marched out in <hi>Battalia</hi> to hinder his entrance, and had poſted themſelves under the Walls in ſhelter of the Engines: However he did not fail to attack them in the Order wherein they were, rather with Fury than hope to overcome them: and all thoſe, which he took both in this Combat
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64918:179"/>and during the whole War, he treated in the moſt cruel manner,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1239</label> and in hatred of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> he cauſed their heads to be cut in a Croſs. After this there were no kind of diſorders, miſeries and calamities, publick and private, which this cruel War did not produce between the two furious Factions of the <hi>Guelphes,</hi> and the <hi>Gibelins,</hi> who like Infernal Furies let looſe with Fire in one hand, and the Sword in the other, laid waſt all the Provinces, and all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> whileſt to ſatisfie their Revenge, they buried one another under the Ruins of their miſerable Country.</p>
                  <p>It was this Rupture, which did the greateſt miſchief to the Army of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> who were already advanced as far as <hi>Lyons.</hi> For the Pope, who ſaw himſelf ſo vigorouſly attacked, was ſo far from giving them any aſſiſtance, that he himſelf deſired it of all the World, and ſent to them to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to procede no further, but to defer their Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> till a more proper and convenient Seaſon.

                  <p>The Governour of <hi>Gaza,</hi> who had by his Spies been advertiſed hereof, laid himſelf in Ambuſh behind ſome little Hills, and all of a ſuddain appeared upon the top of them with ſome of his Squadrons, but without advancing, as firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to obſerve the Countenance of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And accordingly ſeeing that they made a Halt, and ſhewed ſome ſurprize to find thoſe People in order of Battle, whom they had thought to have found aſleep in their Beds, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome Squadrons to deſcend, and charge them at full Speed; and the light <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſes, running as freely upon theſe Sands, as if they had been upon firm ground, they made a furious diſcharge of their Arrows, and then retreated to their main Body, in a little time returning again in greater numbers, ſhooting always without coming nearer than the diſtance of their Arrows, and without danger of being purſued by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who did not without difficulty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance over the heavy Sands; ſo that wheeling and running round about the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my all day, they haraſſed them till Night, a Night that was to be ſpent in Arms, without repoſe, and repaſt, and without the Poſſibility of advancing or retreating, and in nothing but miſerable trouble and waking diſpair, in which they were overwhelmed.</p>
                  <p>And indeed their Fortune was much more deplorable, the next morning, when the whole Army of the Sultan being joined to the Garriſon of <hi>Gaza,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed them on all ſides, and without fear attacking the poor Soldiers alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy half dead, and almoſt unable to carry their Arms, they came to charge them with the Sword and Lance. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed performed in deſpight of their Fortune all that could be expected from men of Courage, and infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Strength; but there was a neceſſity that they muſt yield to multitude with which they were oppreſſed, moſt of them being either ſlain or taken that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable day: <hi>Henry,</hi> Count <hi>de Bar,</hi> one of the moſt Valiant Princes of his time, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Count <hi>de Clermont,</hi> the Lords, <hi>John de Barres, Robert Malet, Richard de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and many others of the Braveſt and moſt remarkable men, remained dead upon the place; The Conſtable <hi>Amauri,</hi> and ſeventy other great <hi>French</hi> Lords, after having fought moſt courageouſly, and by their long reſiſtance given an opportunity to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to make his eſcape, were taken Priſoners and carried in Chains to <hi>Grand Caire.</hi> Thus ended this unhappy Jealouſie, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and Vain Glory, which were governed by raſhneſs and Imprudence in this fatal Encounter of our Ancient Worthies, whoſe misfortune may teach all the Gallant men of our times, that they can never be truely Brave unleſs their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage be regulated by Prudence in the Commanders, and Obediences in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Officers and Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>This unfortunate news did ſo aſtoniſh all the reſt of the Army, which was at <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> in no very good underſtanding among themſelves, that they preſently returned to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where the diviſions, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill among them, as well as between the <hi>Sultans</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> compleated the loſs of all, by two moſt Shameful Treaties with the <hi>Infidels.</hi> For the <hi>Templers,</hi> who had one part of the Army on their ſide, made a

                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince, who following the Example of his Uncle <hi>Richard Coeur de Lyon,</hi> had taken the Croſs with a great Party of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> embarked at <hi>Dover</hi> about Whitſontide, and landing in <hi>France,</hi> paſſed to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was magnificently received by St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who lodged him in his Palace, and cauſed him to be royally treated, and conducted to <hi>Lyons,</hi> from whence paſſing by <hi>Roan,</hi> to <hi>Arles,</hi> where he was to be received by Count <hi>Raymond de Provence,</hi> he came to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> he imbarked upon the Fleet, which he had ſent through the Straits, and upon the eleventh of <hi>October,</hi> in fifteen days after the departure of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> he came to Anchor in the Road of <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> The <hi>Saraſins</hi> had a ſtrange fear upon them, for this Prince, whoſe very name was formidable to them, renewing the memory of the famous <hi>Richard,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who by his marvellous Feats of Arms was ſo terrible to theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> that the Women were wont to quiet their Children when they cried with threatning them with King <hi>Richard;</hi> and the Horſemen to make a Skewiſh boggling Horſe go forward, would commonly ſay to him in clapping their Spurrs to him, <hi>What? doſt think it is King</hi> Richard? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly his Nephew wanted neither Spirit nor Courage, neither Money nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to ſupport a name ſo great, and ſo terribly to the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> He did all that could be expected from a very great Prince, to put things into a Condition, ſo that it might be hoped the War againſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> might be happily proſecuted; for within three days after his arrival he cauſed it to be proclaimed by the ſound of Trumpet through the whole City, That if any one of thoſe, who remained in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> ſtood in need of Money, he would furniſh them during all the time of their Service. But he quickly learnt, that in the deplorable condition to which matters were reduced, by the diviſion, which ſtill continued among the principal Officers, and above all the <hi>Templers</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> there was no appearance of ſucceeding by the way of Arms.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſeeing that it was impoſſible to bring them to any agreement, and that the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> did not at all obſerve the truce, whereas he of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> offered to continue it, with new advantages to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he reſolved at laſt by the advice of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the great Maſter of the Hoſpital, and the greateſt part of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> to accept of it upon theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>That all the Priſoners an each ſide, and eſpecially thoſe, who were taken at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of</hi> Gaza, <hi>ſhould be ſet at liberty; and that the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould enjoy certain Lands, which the Sultan poſſeſſed in</hi> Paleſtine. Mean time the Earl, whileſt he ſtaid for the ratification of the Treaty, cauſed a Fortreſs to be built near <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> which was finiſhed before his departure. After which the Sultan, who acted like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Meledin,</hi> with great Sincerity having ſigned and ratified the Treaty, which he cauſed to be approved by all his Emirs, he ſent back all the Priſoners together with the Conſtable of <hi>Montfort,</hi> who during his Impriſoment had been treated more rigorouſly than all the others, in regard that out of his Generoſity he could never be perſwaded to diſcover the quality of the Barons, who were in Captivity with him. After which <hi>Richard,</hi> having cauſed the bones of the <hi>French,</hi> who were ſlain in the Battle of <hi>Gaza,</hi> to be gathered up, and honourably interred in the Church yard at <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> reimbarked upon his Fleet and ſteered towards <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

For Count <hi>Simon,</hi> his Father, General of the Holy League, and the <hi>Cruſade</hi> againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> having made a great meeting of Barons and Biſhops at <hi>Caſtelnau-d'-Arry,</hi> upon St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s day, in the year twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen, there to celebrate with great Pomp and magnificence, the promotion of his eldeſt Son, <hi>Amauri,</hi> to the order of Knighthood, his abſolute pleaſure was, contrary the common to Cuſtom, that the Ceremony ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Biſhops. And for this purpoſe addreſſing himſelf to two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prelates of their time, <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre,</hi> who was afterwards removed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and who were two Brothers of the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Seignelay,</hi> whoſe name they bore, he obliged them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their modeſt reſiſtance to ſatisfie him, telling them, that ſince he was reſolved that his Son ſhould be a Knight of Jeſus Chriſt, it was reaſonable that he ſhould receive that order by the Hands of the Biſhops, who repreſent Chriſt Jeſus, our Maſter and our King. Thereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Orleance</hi> in his Epiſcopal Habits, having celebrated Maſs in a moſt magnificent Pavilion, which was erected in the Field of <hi>Caſtelnau-d'-Arry,</hi> which was filled with Knights, Soldiers and People, the Count, and Counteſs his Lady, preſented <hi>Amauri</hi> before the Altar, ſupplicating the Biſhops to give him the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood, to ſerve Jeſus Chriſt againſt the Enemies of his Holy Name; then the Biſhop who officiated, and <hi>William,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> kneeling down, girded the Sword about him, and by their Prayers begged the Bleſſings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon this new Knight, who about three Months after ſignalized himſelf in the memorable Battle of <hi>Muret,</hi> where his Father with leſs than two thouſand men defeated a hundred thouſand <hi>Albigenſians</hi> and <hi>Aragoneſes,</hi> under their King, <hi>Peter,</hi> who was ſlain upon the field with twenty thouſand of his men. And afterwards he performed ſo many gallant things, following the Example and the orders of that great Captain, that ſome time after his death, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eighth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him for a Son, who had rendred himſelf moſt worthy of ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſtowed upon him the Sword of a Conſtable of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this brave Count was extremely conſidered by the Pope, both for his own Merit, and for that of the famous <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> he cauſed magnificent Funerals to be made for him at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was interred in the Church of the <hi>Vatican;</hi> his heart, according to his deſire at his death, being carried into <hi>France,</hi> and buried under the Monument, where his Statue lies in the Church of the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of <hi>Hautebruiere,</hi> which is at this day more famous than ever, not only for the rare Vertues of ſo many illuſtrious Virgins as are conſecrated to God, but alſo, by reaſon of the certainty, that beſides the heart of the Conſtable <hi>Amauri,</hi> and the Bodies of his Grandfather and his Uncle, <hi>Gui de Montfort,</hi> there lieth interred that of <hi>Simon</hi> his Father, that invincible Champion of Jeſus Chriſt, who with ſo much Courage and good Fortune combated for his Glory againſt the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſian</hi> Hereticks. For as they were at work in the Year one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty ſix, to repair his Tomb, which is to be ſeen in the middle of that Church, there were found the Bones of a man and a Woman lying in their natural order, wrapped up neatly in Carnation Taffata, which being compared with the inſcription, gives no place for doubting, but that theſe are the Bones of this famous Count, and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wiſe, which are depoſited in that Tomb. And this is ſo far from contradicting, what <hi>Peter du Val de Sernay</hi> writes, that Count <hi>Amauri</hi> cauſed the Body of his Father to be carried from the Field of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> to <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> that it is moſt conformable to him, becauſe he ſays that he cauſed it to be <hi>firſt</hi> carried thither, and that word makes it clear to me, that he had a deſign to tranſport them to ſome other place, after which, according to the cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> in that time, that they had ſeparated the Fleſh from the Bones with boyling Water, which the Hiſtorian expreſſeth by theſe words, <hi>Primùm apud Carcaſſonam curatum Gallico more, exportavit.</hi> They firſt did that to his Body at <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> were accuſtomed to do, and which ſometime after was done to the Body of St <hi>Lowis,</hi> ſeparating the Fleſh from the Bones. The Fleſh and the Intrals of Count <hi>Simon</hi> were interred at <hi>Carcaſſone,</hi>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:64918:181"/>and the Bones were tranſported into <hi>France</hi> by his Son into the Earldom,

Thus it was that the Conſtable <hi>Amauri de Montfort</hi> ended his days at <hi>Otranto</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> at the ſame time that <hi>Richard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Sicily,</hi> after he had conſerred with the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> paſſed to <hi>Rome</hi> to endeavour an accomodation of matters with the Pope, whom he found ſtill firm and inflexible in his refolution to have intire Satisfaction; but yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs extremely troubled with the ſad news, which he had received of the taking of his Legates, and all the Prelates, which he had convoked to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope conſidering the pitious condition, to which the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the Eaſt were reduced, and that <hi>Frederick</hi> drawing his advantage from this ill Succeſs, charged it all upon the Pope, to render him odious to all the Princes; and that he became ſtill more powerful and more hot in his Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and that while the Weſt was troubled with this War, it was impoſſible for any <hi>Cruſade</hi> to proſper in the Eaſt; all theſe conſiderations had made him reſolve in the preceding Year, according to the advice of the King, St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who paſſionately deſired the Peace of the Church, to call a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> to meet in Eaſter of this Year, to which he invited all the Princes and Prelates of <hi>Chriſtendom. Frederick</hi> himſelf at firſt made ſome appearance of conſenting to it, and in order thereto to admit of a Truce with the Pope; but he preſently changed his opinion, and upon the demand that the <hi>Lombards</hi> ſhould be alſo compriſed in this truce, to the end that this War might not obſtruct the Freedom of paſſage to the Council, he took occaſion to write to all Princes, whom he endeavoured to intereſt in his Cauſe, in which Letters he complained, <hi>That this Council was not called by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>his mortal and declared Enemy, for any other end, but to give his Rebellious Subjects, who were at the laſt gaſp, the leiſure to take breath, and to renew the War with more Vigour than before, at the ſame time when he would condemn and depoſe him in a Council, wherein his Capital Enemy was to preſide, and wherein it was well known, that many People, who were Enemies to the Empire, and others of whom he was well aſſured, that they were his Creatures and dependants, were to be his Judges. That for theſe reaſons he deſired them to advertiſe all the Prelates in their Dominions, that they ſhould forbear this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for which he could not promiſe them any ſafety, in regard, that though for the love of the Princes, his Friends and Allies, he was ready to favour their Subjects in all things, he was nevertheleſs abſolutely reſolved not to permit any that ſhould be ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to go to a Council, which was called againſt him by his mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mean while he cauſed all the Paſſages to be diligently guarded, taking, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, treating ill and cruelly Maſſacring ſome of thoſe, who adventured to go by Land; and to guard the Sea, he ſet out a great Fleet, and armed out twenty new Gallies at <hi>Naples</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which towards the end of <hi>March</hi> joined thoſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who were of the Emperor's Party, under <hi>Entius,</hi> the King of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> The Pope alſo on his ſide having a great Soul, as upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he made apparent, and a Vigour much ſurpaſſing his Age, which now approached to a hundred years, and whoſe Courage was invincible in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Rights of the Church and the Supream dignity of the Pontificate, writ the moſt curious Letters in the World to all Prelates, to exhort them by all Conſiderations, both Divine and humane, to deſpiſe the Menaces of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and generouſly to expoſe themſelves to all hazards, for the Service of the Church in the moſt important of all occaſions, which was to hinder her from being oppreſſed and robbed intirely of all her Liberty, promiſing them withal, that he would take care to Arm ſo potently at Sea for their ſafe paſſage, that they

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1241</label> And in truth he gave particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and moſt preſſing orders to Cardinal <hi>Gregory,</hi> whom he had ſent Legate to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to ſpare for no charges to reinforce his Fleet with a great number of Ships, which he was to join with thoſe of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> who made no doubt, but they ſhould be able to beat all that they ſhould encounter upon the Sea, promiſed with ſo much certainty and Conſidence to the Prelates of <hi>France, Spain, England</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> who were come to that Port, with the two Legates of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that they would conduct them to <hi>Rome</hi> without any manner of danger, that they reſolved to venture that paſſage rather than truſt to the offers of the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>For that Politick Prince ſeeing them arrived at <hi>Genoa,</hi> notwithſtanding all his menaces, changed his method; and whether it were, that he had a deſign to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, or that he would thereby endeavour to perſuade the World, that he was ready on his ſide to make all manner of reaſonable advances, towards Peace, which could be expected from him, he offered them all the Security, which they could deſire, and in ſuch manner as ſhould beſt like them for their free paſſage through <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Romanca,</hi> that ſo he might have the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of informing them of the Juſtice of his care; it being as he ſaid, altogether unreaſonable, that, after having already been condomned by his Enemy, <hi>Gregory,</hi> without being heard, he ſhould alſo be condemned by thoſe, whom the Pope had called together to ſerve his own Paſſion againſt an Emperor, who deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but throughly to inſtruct them, after which he would willingly ſubmit to their Judgment. But the Prelates durſt not truſt to the Faith of a Prince, who was accuſed not to have too great an Honour for his word; and being encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Pope, and the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Admiral, who conſidently affirmed always that they ſhould not need to fear any thing, they all in concluſion went aboard the Fleet, except the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Bourges</hi> and of <hi>Tours,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and ſome others, who not finding the Convoy, that was promiſed them beyond <hi>Vienna,</hi> and judging it was not ſafe for them to paſs any further, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their reſpective Dioceſſes.</p>
                  <p>And certainly it appeared quickly after, that they had acted with reaſon and foreſight; for the Enemies Fleet, which expected that of <hi>Genoa</hi> in their paſſage, meeting with them about <hi>Piſa;</hi> there was a neceſſity of coming to an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was very fatal to the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and to all the Prelates, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted.

At firſt <hi>Frederick</hi> made ſome difficulty to deliver them, they being, as he ſaid, his Enemies; but the King writ to him a Letter ſo reaſonable, but withal ſo poſitive, giving him to underſtand, on the one hand, that they had no manner of intention to do him prejudice; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that though he had a reſolution to maintain a good underſtanding with the Empire, yet he was not depoſed to purchaſe it at the rate of ſo diſobliging and diſhonourable a refuſal of his demands; inſomuch that this Prince, as fierce as he was, being afraid to provoke a King, whom he both extremely honoured and feared, in conſequence upon his more cool and deliberate thoughts, judged it convenient to ſatisfie him, and therefore ſent home his Biſhops and Abbots into <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>It was the General belief of the World that this Election, would fully reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Peace of the Church, in regard that this Pope, while he was Cardinal, had been a mighty Friend to <hi>Frederick,</hi> and that at firſt the Emperor, ſent to him a magnificent Ambaſſage, to congratulate him upon his Exaltation, to offer him whatever was in his power, by ſubmitting himſelf intirely to him in all things, the Rights and Dignities of his Empire and his Realms always excepted. After this alſo he ſent his Chancellor, <hi>Peter de Vignes,</hi> and <hi>Thadeus de Seſſa,</hi> who promiſed ſolemnly in his behalf, and with an Oath, that he would ſtand to his Judgment, as to the ſatisfaction, which he was to make; inſomuch that there ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no doubt, but Peace would be concluded. But this belief was quickly loſt; for the Pope having ſent his Legates to the Emperor, to let him know that he was ready to receive him to peace and to the Communion of the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that he purged himſelf of thoſe Crimes, for which <hi>Gregory</hi> had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him; and that <hi>Innocent</hi> on his ſide was diſpoſed to give him ſatisfaction, if in a General Council, which ſhould judge of it, it ſhould be found that he had offended.

This Prince, who was a very good Chriſtian, and unwilling to have any thing lie upon his Conſcience, which might hinder him from courageouſly expoſing himſelf to death, demanded abſolution of him two ſeveral times before they came to charge. And as this Prelate without doubt criminally rigorous, and too ſevere in an occaſion of this nature, perſiſted obſtinately in his refuſal to give it him. The Biſhop of <hi>Rama,</hi> a man of great Courage, and who made uſe of the Sword in this War againſt the <hi>Inſidels,</hi> as well as of the Croſs in his Church, unable to indure that by this accident ſo much leiſure was given to the Enemies to range their Troops, cried out aloud, <hi>My Lord, Let not this Scruple trouble you any longer, Let us charge. The Patriarch is in the Fault, and therefore I abſolve you in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thereupon the Count, who took it for a ſufficient abſolution went to the Charge with his Lance couched, and being followed by his Valiant Biſhop, he threw himſelf into the thickeſt Battalions and Squadrons of the Enemies, in the place where he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Prince of the <hi>Coraſmins</hi> invironed with all the moſt brave of his Army.</p>

Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Christians,</hi> though abandoned by theſe Cowards, yet never fought more bravely, being reſolved rather to periſh in the Field of Battle than ever to quit it. So that after having always maintained their ground without ever recoiling one ſtep in two days from Morning until night: at laſt oppreſſed by the Multitude of their Enemies, who were not only ſtout men, but alſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpaſſed them in number, and of whom notwithſtandhing they made a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Carnage, they were almoſt all either ſlain upon the place, or taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

For the Prince of the <hi>Coraſmins,</hi> who thought to make advantage of his being taken, to gain the City and Caſtle of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> cauſed the Valiant Count, to be bound under his Arms to a Croſs, which he had erected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate of the Caſtle, telling the Soldiers of the Garriſon, who from the walls beheld this woful Spectacle, that he would in the moſt cruel manner put the Count to death, except they preſently ranſomed his life by the ſurrender of the place. But this invincible <hi>Hero,</hi> making a Sacrifice of his life to Jeſus Chriſt, to ſave that little remainder of his Inheritance in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> cried to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as loud as ever he could from his Croſs, that they ſhould take no care for him, but leaving him to the rage of theſe Dogs, to whom he ſhould be obliged for the Crown of Martyrdom, that they ſhould courageouſly defend the place with which he had intruſted them not only for himſelf, but to preſerve it for Jeſus Chriſt, for whoſe only ſake they had come into <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>

It was at this Council that the Cardinals received from <hi>Innocent</hi> the Red-Hat for a diſtinction of their Dignity, and the Obligation which they had to looſe even their Lives for the cauſe of God and of his Church, eſpecially in this Perſecution of the Emperor <hi>Frederick.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> as alſo thoſe of <hi>Aquilea</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this Council, together with one hundred and fourty Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops of <hi>France, Italy, Spain, England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Deputies of many other places, the Abbots of <hi>Cluni,</hi> the <hi>Ciſtercians</hi> and <hi>Claraval,</hi> the General of the order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and the Vicar of that of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> as alſo a great number of other Abbots and Priors of the ſame Kingdoms. There came ſcarcely any at all from <hi>Germany,</hi> for fear of offending the Emperor, nor from <hi>Hungary,</hi> by reaſon of the irruption, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had made at that time into thoſe Countries. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who came to deſire aſſiſtance from the Pope was there alſo together with <hi>Raymond,</hi> Count of <hi>Tholoſe, Raymond, Berenger,</hi> Count <hi>de Provence,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor, the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> and the other <hi>Christian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Affairs of the greateſt moment certainly paſſed with wonderful Expedition, in thoſe times in Compariſon of what they do in our days. For this great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, wherein matters of the Greateſt Importance were treated of, the ſmalleſt of which would now take up much a longer time, and would be diſcuſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with extraordinary difficulty, was finiſhed in three Seſſions. In the firſt of them the Pope being ſeated upon a Throne, which was raiſed in the great Church at <hi>Lyons,</hi> having at his Right hand the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and upon his Left the other Princes, he made a moſt <hi>Pathetick</hi> Diſcourſe, in which comparing his pains and Grief to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, he ſaid that the Church had received five great Wounds, from which it was impoſſible but he muſt be extremely ſenſible of her pain. The firſt, was the abuſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which were ſo frequent among the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> The Second, was by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64918:185"/>the Inſolence and the Tyranny of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> who had prophaned the Sacred places, and laid waſt the Holy City, and were upon the point of taking all that remained in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> from the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The third Wound was that which was given by the Schiſm of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe power, though it had been brought down, yet now began to riſe again and even to threaten <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was reduced to the laſt Extremities. The fourth was by the furious irruption of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> even to the very conſines of <hi>Germany,</hi> where they filled all with Blood, Slaughter and Ruin. The Fifth was by the terrible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of <hi>Frederick,</hi> who expoſed the Church to all thoſe Sufferings, for which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had cut him off from the Body of the Church, in which he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted, but daily augmented his former guilt by new and greater Crimes. After which, the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Valeran,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Berylus,</hi> who was ſent by the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to implore the Succour of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Weſt, gave a Relation of the deplorable condition, wherein the Affairs of the <hi>Latins</hi> were in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> And then <hi>Thadeus de Seſſa,</hi> the Judge of the Imperial Palace, and the Emperors Ambaſſador, roſe up and ſpoke to the Council in the name of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, that he might gain the Favour of the Aſſembly, he repeated in general, and few words, what the Pope had ſaid concerning the <hi>Saraſins, Greeks, Tartars,</hi> and the Emperor, and proteſted, that <hi>Frederick,</hi> whoſe Power by reaſon of ſo many Victories, as he had gained againſt his Enemies, was greater than ever it had been before, offered himſelf withal his heart to employ all that he had, his Fortunes and his Arms, to reduce the <hi>Greeks</hi> to reaſon, and to repulſe the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and that he was ready to go himſelf in perſon, and at his own charges, into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to drive out the <hi>Coraſmins,</hi> and there to reeſtabliſh the Affairs of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which were in ſuch ill terms; and that in the mean time he promiſed to reſtore to the Church whatſoever ſhould be found that he had taken from it, and to make all the ſatisfaction that could be expected, if in any thing he had offended. To this the Pope, not doubting but all this was ſaid, as an Artifice to ſurprize and amuſe the Council, only anſwered, that they were not met there to talk of new promiſes, but to ſee that he performed thoſe, which he had already made upon his Oath, which he had ſo often eluded. <hi>And then,</hi> added he, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>having ſo often deceived us, what Caution will he give to Warrant, that which he promiſeth? The Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England, boldly and without delay anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thadeus, ought not they to be accepted? By no means,</hi> replyed the Pope, <hi>becauſe if he ſhould again fail in his promiſes, as thereis reaſon enough to believe that he will, we ſhall be obliged to take our remedy againſt theſe two Kings. So that the Church for one Enemy, which ſhe hath now upon her hands, ſhall then have three, which are the three moſt puiſſant Princes in all</hi> Europe.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Thadeus</hi> continuing his diſcourſe to come to the point, which was in queſtion, and upon which he was defired to inſiſt, he endeavoured to anſwer preciſely to all the Crimes, which the Pope had objected againſt <hi>Frederick.</hi> And being very dexterous and wonderful Eloquent, he ſpoke with ſo much Art, and gave ſo ſoft and plauſible a turn to his defence, that there were very many in the Aſſembly, who appeared highly ſatisfied. But <hi>Innocent,</hi> who was a very able man, and who was perfectly well acquainted with all the Circumſtances of this Affair, replied inſtantly to all that the Emperors Ambaſſadour had ſaid in defence of his Maſter, and anſwered to every particular, with as much exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Strength, as if he had been a long time before prepared, by ſeeing what <hi>Thadeus</hi> would ſay upon this Subject. And this was what was done in this firſt Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the Second, which was held eight days after, upon Tueſday the fifth of <hi>July,</hi> diverſe Biſhops, eſpecially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were come in greater numbers to the Council than any other Nation, tendered an accuſation conſiſting in many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles againſt the Emperor, urging the Pope to condemn him, eſpecially upon this whereon they inſiſted principally, That it was the intention of that Prince, as appeared by his own Letters, to diſpoil the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> of all their Eſtates, and to reduce them to the ſame condition that they were in, during the times of the primitive Perſecution. The Ambaſſadour on the other ſide endeavoured to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64918:186"/>ſatisfie the Council in every particular of the Charge.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> But perceiving that the greateſt part of his Judges, were not like to be favourable to him, he deſired, that at leaſt it might be deferred for ſome days till the third Seſſion, to the end, that the Emperor, who he aſſured them was upon his way to come to the Council, might have time according to his deſire, to make his appearance. To this, the Pope willingly conſented, as believing that if that Prince were preſent, all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences would eaſily be adjuſted. And although many, who deſired that this Affair ſhould be quickly determined, oppoſed it, he gave twelve days reſpit, in which they laboured in the private meetings to regulate all the other matters, that were under debate. At laſt the term being expired, and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who would by no means acknowledge the Council to be the Judge of his differences with the Pope, did not appear, the third Seſſion was held upon the Monday, being the ſeventeenth day of <hi>July,</hi> where the ſeventeen Decrees, which were made for the reformation of manners and diſcipline, were approved, as alſo thoſe, for finding out the ways to ſuccour the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to oppoſe the irruption of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and for the Publication of a <hi>Cruſade,</hi> againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who poſſeſſed the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which was decreed upon this Article was, <hi>That the</hi> Cruſade <hi>ſhould be preached in all places; That thoſe, who had already taken upon them the Croſs, and had not accompliſhed their Vow, ſhould be conſtrained by the Prelates to take it up, upon pain of Excommunication; That the Ancient</hi> Cruſades, <hi>and thoſe who ſhould take it up anew, ſhould at a certain time and place to be appointed, repair to the Pope to receive his Benediction; That there ſhould be either a Peace or a Truce for four years, among all the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes; That during all that time, there ſhould be no publick Turnaments or Tiltings held; That the Lords of the</hi> Cruſade <hi>ſhould retrench all manner of Superfluity, and Vain Magnificence in their train, their Equipage, their habits, and their Tables; That the Biſhops ſhould take great care to exhort their People, and eſpecially ſuch upon whom they impoſed any Pennance for their Crimes, to contribute ſome part of their Goods to the</hi> Holy War; <hi>and that they ſhould keep an exact Regiſter of what was thus collected; That all the Eccleſiaſticks ſhould be obliged to pay for this War the twentieth part of their Revenue for three years, thoſe only excepted, who took up the Croſs themſelves; and that the Pope and the Cardinals ſhould pay the tenth to give an example to others, who might be aſhamed not to follow them.</hi> And in ſhort, all the Privileges granted by the Councils, and by the Popes in Favour of the <hi>Cruſades</hi> were confirmed, and all thoſe Puniſhments denounced by the Bullas and the Canons againſt ſuch as enterpriſed any thing againſt the Perſons or Eſtates of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> or againſt ſuch as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Pyrates,</hi> or carried Arms to the Infidels, were alſo ratified. And for the obtaining the aid of God Almighty, it was ordered that Prayers ſhould be made in all Churches in the Octaves of the Nativity of our Bleſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>After this the Cauſe of the Emperor, who had refuſed to appear, was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration; And as his Ambaſſador <hi>Thadeus,</hi> perceived that the Sentence, which was already prepared, was going to be pronounced by the Pope, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted aloud againſt it, to ſtop it from proceding any further, crying, <hi>That he appealed to a general Councel.</hi> To which the Pope replyed with great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That this was one that all the Prelates and Princes had been called to; and that if the Biſhops of</hi> Germany, <hi>and ſome others were not preſent, it was the Fault of his Maſter, who had hindred them from coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other part, Hugh <hi>Bigod, William de Chanteloup,</hi> and <hi>Philip Baſſet,</hi> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England,</hi> who favoured <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Brother-in-Law of their King, whoſe Siſter he had married, to gain time preſented to the Pope Letters in the Name of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which contained two very nice points, wherein they demanded to have Juſtice done them; and which doubtleſs would take up a great deal of time. The firſt was upon what the late King <hi>John</hi> had done, who in deſpight and contrary to all right, as well as againſt the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his People, had, they ſaid, made a Donation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Pope, to have the Crown for the future held of the <hi>Holy See;</hi> which they proteſted was wholly null and void, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the name of the whole Body of the Realm oppoſed it. The Second
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64918:186"/>was a complaint to the Pope that his Legates, Nuncio's and other Miniſters,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> whom he ſent into <hi>England,</hi> beſides the levying of the Peter-Pence, made there under a thouſand Pretexts ſuch inſupportable Exactions upon the People, as they were reſolved no longer to ſuffer. To this, <hi>Innocent,</hi> who eaſily diſcovered the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, anſwered coldly, That the Council being not aſſembled for thoſe matters, the diſcuſſion of them muſt be deferred till ſome other time, wherein they might be debated more fully and with more leiſure. And then, after having acquainted the Aſſembly with how much reſpect, Honour, and all the Teſtimonies of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection, he had treated the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> both before and ſince his Pontificate, and acquainted them how many times, he had ineffectually endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reduce him to his Duty by mild and gentle methods, he firſt pronounced the Sentence againſt him <hi>viva voce,</hi> and afterwards cauſed it to be read, by which, <hi>He declared him excommunicate; deprived him of the Empire and all his Realms, and of all manner of Honours, preheminences and Dignities, for all thoſe Crimes, which are therein at large expreſſed, abſolving all his Subjects from the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which they had taken to him; and expreſly prohibiting all manner of perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Excommunication, to acknowledge him either as Emperor, or as King, or in that quality to give him either Counſel or Aid:</hi> And at the ſame time the Biſhops, who held the Tapers lighted in their hands, approved and confirmed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and in extinguiſhing them, pronounced the <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt him. After which, the Pope riſing from his Throne, began the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> with which Hymn this famous Council was concluded; in which, there was neither De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, nor Canon made concerning matters of Faith, though there were many Hereſies in thoſe times, there being nothing made, but certain Regulations for the Diſcipline of the Church; and after the Judgment, which was given againſt <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Pope decided nothing, but a Politick and tender Affair of State, in which all Sovereigns ſeemed to have a great Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>For upon occaſion of this Council, the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal</hi> being diſatisfied with their King <hi>Dom Sanches,</hi> whom in by reaſon of the weakneſs of his Mind, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved unfit and unable to govern, they ſent to <hi>Lyons</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbra,</hi> to requeſt from the Pope, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to place upon the Throne his Brother, Prince <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who was his preſumptive Heir, and who poſſeſſed all the admirable Qualities, which could be deſired in a King. <hi>Innocent,</hi> who underſtood that an action of this nature might produce very dangerous Conſequences, would by no means conſent to what they deſired; yet nevertheleſs he was willing, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in the room of the King, to whom he ordered, that they ſhould give a ſufficient allowance for the ſupport of his Royal Dignity, in what ever place he ſhould chuſe for his retreat. But the moſt of the Governours of places would not at all conſent to this Change, which they did not believe to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the ſpiritual Juriſdiction, to which the Popes in Virtue of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority derived from Jeſus Chriſt, either ought to pretend, or had any Right to determine. And conſequently they refuſed abſolutely to receive <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Oath, which they had taken to the King. And the Action, which was done upon this occaſion by the generous <hi>Martin Flecho,</hi> Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Conimbra,</hi> deſerves the commendation of all Poſterity. This brave man having maintained the Siege againſt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> with ſo much conſtancy, that having ſpent all their Proviſions, he and the Soldiers were reduced to feed upon Hides and the Coverings of Trunks; at length a Meſſage was ſent to him, that now he might ſurrender the place and yet ſave his Honour, by reaſon that <hi>Dom Sanches,</hi> the King was dead at <hi>Toledo</hi> without Iſſue; he deſired a Truce for ſo many days as was neceſſary for him to go thither and return back again; which being granted, he took Poſt and ſo ſoon as he came thither, he cauſed the Tomb of the King, his Maſter, to be opened in the Preſence of a Publick Notary and Witneſſes, and ſeeing that he was really dead he put the Keys of the Caſtle, with which that Prince had intruſted him, into his hands, and had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; And then returning within the Term, which he had demanded, he ſet open the Gates to receive his new King; leaving to all Subjects an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Example of that Inviolable Fidelity, which they owe to their Soveraigns; and a fair Copy for all Soldiers, to ſhew them in what manner they ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64918:187"/>a place they are inſtruſted with, that ſo they may anſwer the expectation, of their King, who hath done them the Honour to commit it to their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> Mean time the Council being thus ended with the Condemnation of <hi>Frederick;</hi> that Prince, who was then at <hi>Turin,</hi> conceived at it an extreme grief mixed with Fury, Choler, and Contempt, which he manifeſted by a moſt ſurprizing Action. For cauſing his Crown to be brought to him, he put it upon his Head, and then addreſſing himſelf to thoſe about him. <hi>This Crown,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which you now ſee upon my head, is not to be diſpoſed of, or loſt by the Decrees of the Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; there muſt be other kind of Arms employed to take it from me, and there will be whole Rivers of Blood let out before that be done.</hi> And thereupon he writ to all the Kings and Princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> large Letters, in which he anſwered in Order to every particular point of the Sentence, ſhewing the nullity of it by all the reaſons, which could be drawn either from Law or Fact, and above all he endeavoured to intereſt all Kings in his Cauſe, which he ſaid was the Common Cauſe of all Soveraigns. He proteſted that he did in this occaſion, defend not only his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but all their Rights in maintaining as he did, That though thoſe Crimes which were falſely objected againſt him, and thoſe which might be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other Princes, were undoubtedly true, yet neither Popes, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils had any manner of Right to puniſh them by depriving them of the leaſt part of their Temporal Rights, over which Jeſus Chriſt had not given them any manner of Power, and conſequently did not in any way appertain to them to concern themſelves about. Adding further, that as he was not the firſt Prince in whom ambitious and medling Popes had endeavoured to depoſe and diſpoſſeſs of their Crowns, ſo he ſhould not be the laſt, unleſs all Kings would joyn with him to oppoſe an Uſurpation ſo dangerous and prejudicial to the Rights of all Crowned Heads, who for their Temporal Dignities depended upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther except God alone. He remonſtrated to them, that according to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the ſource and Spring of all this diſorder was the overgrown Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power of the Church; and ſo far was he from retracting what he had been accuſed for in the Council to have ſaid, that it was neceſſary to reduce the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks</hi> to the condition, wherein they were in the Primitive Church, that he took God to Witneſs that this was his Intention, and to begin with the greateſt and the richeſt; and that this was certainly a work of great Charity, to take from them thoſe great Riches, which were the Cauſe of all their diſorders, and to reduce them to that State of happy Poverty, which rendred their Predeceſſors like to the Apoſtles by doing of Miracles, and not thinking to triumph like Kings, but by their Sanctity, and the holineſs of their Lives and Doctrine, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſubmitting themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt. And in ſhort he exhorted all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to join with him to take from the Eccleſiaſticks, of what quality ſoever, all that was ſuperfluous, to the end that contenting themſelves with a little, they might have the greater Liberty to ſerve God the better.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſay that there are many things to be anſwered to this deſign of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> and that it is eaſie to oppoſe it with many invincible reaſons. But this ſhall not hinder me here from making one little remark, which ſo far as I believe hath never been made by any Perſon, and which may be of uſe to ſuch as apply themſelves to reading of Hiſtory. <hi>Matthew Pariso,</hi> an Engliſh man, and a Monk of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> a rich Abby in England, who writ in thoſe times, declares himſelf openly upon all occaſions for <hi>Frederick,</hi> whom he praiſeth rather with the Affectation of an Orator than the Modeſty of an Hiſtorian, and does ſo eternally exclaim againſt the Popes, whoſe conduct he blames in a Manner, which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing even to thoſe, who are not too favourable to the <hi>Holy See;</hi> but in this place he turns his Stile on the ſuddain, and his own Pittance coming to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Revenue of his Monaſtry, which according to <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Deſign was to be retrenched; he declames fearfully againſt this Emperor, ſaying, that by his writing at this rate he loſt all the Reputation, which he had acquired of being a Wiſe and Prudent Prince, and rendred himſelf extremely ſuſpected of Hereſie. This makes it evident, that an interreſted Writer, changeth his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not only according to the Nature and Quality of the Perſons, which are changed, but according to the differing Proſpects, which his Intereſt gives
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64918:187"/>him, in which he finds himſelf ingaged in what he writes.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> So that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of this Author, who hath very good things, I have endeavoured to make a juſt difference betwixt what he writes, as himſelf, and thoſe authentick Pieces, which he produceth, which give great inſight into the true Hiſtory, ſuch as are the Relations ſent by thoſe, who had a ſhare in the Affairs then tranſacted, the Letters of the Popes and Princes, as alſo thoſe of the Emperor, which contain, what I have now related, and which the continuator of <hi>Baronius,</hi> hath inſerted into his Annals, printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Reader may find this and much more to the ſame purpoſe that I have recounted,</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Frederick</hi> did not ſatisfie himſelf with Writings, but puſhing on his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to all things, which his Vindicative Nature, and his Anger furiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed could tranſport him, there was nothing which he did not attempt, or which he did not put in Execution to revenge himſelf of the Pope; perſecuting and ruining his Relations, baniſhing and diſpoiling them of all their Eſtates, as he did all the Prieſts and Biſhops, who refuſed to celebrate the Divine Offices in thoſe places where he was; conſtraining all the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> to pay the third part of their Revenues to maintain the War againſt the Pope. Making uſe of Fire and Sword and all thoſe Violent Ways by himſelf and his <hi>Gibelins</hi> againſt all thoſe, who were of the Pope's Party. So that the Pope was obliged in his own defence againſt ſuch a Potent Enemy to cauſe a <hi>Cruſade</hi> to be preached by his Cordeliers againſt him and his Sons, who on their ſide acted with as much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Ardour as their Father. Thus the Succours deſigned for <hi>Conſtamino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> againſt <hi>Vatacus,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and thoſe for <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> were fruſtrated, and the Troubles of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which inſued upon the Condemnation of <hi>Frederick</hi> and the <hi>Cruſade</hi> which was publiſhed againſt that Prince, were ſo many diverſions, which weakned the Principal <hi>Cruſade</hi> in ſuch a manner, that notwithſtanding that, it was reſolved in the Council againſt the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins.</hi> Of all the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> there was none, except St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who with the <hi>French</hi> only undertook the <hi>Holy War,</hi> he having taken upon him the Croſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Council of <hi>Lyons.</hi>

                  <p>For as in the Year before, after his return from the War of <hi>Poitu,</hi> where he had ſo gloriouſly vanquiſhed the Earl of <hi>Marche,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Tailebourg,</hi> he fell ſick in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> and by the Violence of the Diſtemper, he was reduced to that Extremity, that he was believed to be dead, remaining without pulſe and without Senſe for one whole day; inſomuch that they were conſulting of his Funerals, when ſuddainly comming, as it were, out of an Ecſtaſie, and bleſſing God, who had drawn him from the Gates of Death; and looking upon the Standers by, he made choice among all the Biſhops, who where aſſembled in his Chamber, of the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was at that time the famous <hi>William d' Avergne,</hi> whom his learned Writings, and the eminent Sanctity of his life have rendred ſo much celebrated. He preſently called him to him and deſired him to faſten a Croſs to his Right Shoulder, as a mark of the immoveable Reſolution, which he had taken after the example, of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, <hi>Philip</hi> the Auguſt, and his great Grandfather, <hi>Lewis</hi> the young, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the <hi>Holy War,</hi> for the deliverance of the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt: and he ſpoke to him in a manner ſo reſolute, either becauſe in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity wherein he was, he had made a Vow to take upon him the Croſs if it ſhould pleaſe God to deliver him, or elſe as an ancient Writer aſſures us, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this long Swoon, which <hi>Nanges</hi> calls an Ecſtaſy, he had a Viſion in which he thought he ſaw the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army vanquiſh by the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> as it was before <hi>Gaza,</hi> and heard a Voice from Heaven, which ſaid to him, <hi>King of</hi> France, <hi>Go and revenge this irreparable Loſs.</hi> Let it be how it will, it is certain, that notwithſtanding the Prayers and the Tears of the two Queens, his Mother and his Wife, who conjured him upon their Knees to deferr the taking of ſuch a Reſolution till he was in a better condition, he proteſted that he would neither take any nouriſhment, nor Medicin, till ſuch time as he had received the Croſs. Inſomuch that in concluſion the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> all in Tears, faſtned the Croſs upon him, whileſt the Queens, the Princes, his Bothers, and all thoſe who were preſent began afreſh to weep as if he had again been at the point of death; but he on the contrary with a pleaſant Countenance and a perfect aſſurance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64918:188"/>his extreme weakneſs,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> proteſted, that God would reſtore him to his health for the accompliſhment of his Vow. And in ſhort, in a little time he recovered, and whileſt he ſtaid till the condition of his Affairs would permit him to paſs the Sea with a powerful Army, he continually ſent great Succours of men and money into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> with many Knights of the Temple and Hoſpital to encourage the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vigourouſly againſt the Forces of <hi>Egypt</hi> in Expectation of his comming in perſon to their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in Execution of the Decree of the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> touching the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> ſent Cardinal <hi>Eudes</hi> of Caſtle-<hi>Roax,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> his Legate, into <hi>France,</hi> to publiſh it in that Realm. The King received him at <hi>Paris,</hi> with all kind of magnificence, and to give the greater weight to the Publication of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> he called to meet in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> in the Octaves of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> a great aſſembly of the Princes, Prelates, and Barons, where he ſpoke ſo powerfully to animate them to the <hi>Holy War,</hi> taking upon him the Office of a Preacher after the Legate, that the greateſt part of the Aſſembly following his example, took upon them the Croſs. The moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſignal among them were the three Princes, the Brothers of the King, <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> Count <hi>de Poitiers, Robert,</hi> Count <hi>d' Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> Count <hi>d' Anjou.</hi> The Princeſſes, their Ladies, imitating the example of the Queen, who reſolved to go along with the King, alſo took upon them the Croſs. So much Piety and Courage, ſo much love had they for theſe three brave Princes, their Husbands, that they would alſo pertake with them, the pains and the dangers of this War, leaving to them all the Glory, to which their Sex would not permit them to pretend. Alſo <hi>Hugh,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Peter,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretany, William,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders, Hugh de Chaſtillon,</hi> Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Gautier de Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> his Nephew, <hi>Hugh de Luſignan,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and his Son <hi>Hugh</hi> the Brown, followed them, together with the Counts <hi>de Dreux, de Bar, de Soiſſons, de Blois, de Retel, de Montfort,</hi> and <hi>de Vendoſme.</hi> The Lords, <hi>John de Beajeu,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France, John de Beaumont,</hi> Admiral, and great Chamberlain of <hi>France, Philip de Courtenay, Guion de Flanders, Archambald de Bourbon</hi> the Younger, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oul de Couci, John de Barres, Gaubert,</hi> and <hi>John de Apremont, Giles de Mailli, Robert de Bethune</hi> of <hi>Arras, Oliver de Termes, and Simon,</hi> Count <hi>de Sarbruc,</hi> and Lord <hi>de Comerci,</hi> Companion in Arms with the famous <hi>Seneſchal de Champagne, John Sire de Joinville,</hi> ſo celebrated for the gallant Actions, which he performed in this Voyage for ſeven years, and for the Hiſtory, which he writ of the great Actions of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and for the extraordinary Eſteem in which he was to this great Prince for one of the moſt Wiſe and moſt Valiant Knights of his time, inſomuch that he thought him worthy to be honoured, with being his particular Confident. There were alſo many great Prelates, who reſolved to be of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> as <hi>Jubellus, de Mathfellons,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> the Holy Man <hi>Philip Berruier,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> moſt Illuſtrious by his Vertues, by his Doctrine, and by his Miracles, <hi>Robert de Creſſonſart,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais, Garnier,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, William de Buſſy,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and laſtly the Cardinal Legate, whom the Pope had deſigned, not only to publiſh the <hi>Cruſade</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as he did in many Provinces, but alſo to accompany the King in this War.</p>
                  <p>It was with this magnificent and fair train of Lords of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> that <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> accompanied with the Queen <hi>Blanch,</hi> his Mother, came about the end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> to the Famous Abby of <hi>Cluny,</hi> where the Pope, who was arrived there from <hi>Lyons,</hi> met him with twelve Cardinals, the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a great number of Prelates, to conferr with the King, where in Perſon he celebrated the Maſs in his Pontificalibus, upon St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s day. It is ſaid that this Famous Abby, was then of ſo great extent, and had ſo many appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Pope, the King, the Queen, the Cardinals, the Princes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Lords, were all lodged moſt commodiouſly there with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, without giving any diſturbance to the Religious, or obliging them to quit their Chambers, or any places in the Monaſtry, which were deſigned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Service or for the performance of their Functions. The Pope, the King and Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> were there for ſeven days in continual ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64918:188"/>which as it was believed, were principally to treat of a Reconciliation,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1245</label> between the Emperor and the Pope, leſt that unhappy difference, might either retard or weaken the effect of this <hi>Cruſade;</hi> but all came to nothing, although this did not hinder King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was equally Wiſe and Religious, and who would not enter further, into that Affair than became him, from living perfectly well with the Pope, and yet without breaking with <hi>Frederick,</hi> who at the ſame time did what lay in his Power, to preſerve himſelf in Amity with the King.</p>
                  <p>And truely not contenting himſelf only to have writ in his own defence, as he did to other Kings preſently after the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> he ſent to him the year following, the famous <hi>Peter de Vignes,</hi> his Councellour, and <hi>William d' Ocre,</hi> one of the principal Miniſters, with Letters addreſſed to all the <hi>French,</hi> by which, after having complained of the Enterpriſes, which he pretended the Pope's abuſing their Power, made upon the temporal Rights, both of Princes and private Perſons, in many differing ways, which he expoſed; he proteſted, that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this abuſe were reformed, he was ready to ſubmit to the Judgment of the King and his Barons, all the differences, which were betwixt him and the Pope; and moreover provided, that either the <hi>Lombards,</hi> were obliged to give him that Obedience, which was due to him; or in caſe of their refuſal, that whileſt he endeavoured to compel them to it, the Pope ſhould not ſupport them in their Rebellion, he promiſed to go to the Conqueſt of the Holy Land, either by himſelf, or with the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or to ſend thither the King his Son, as King <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould judge to be moſt convenient, and not to give over the Enterpriſe, until the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were put into poſſeſſion of the whole Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And if this Peace could not be had upon theſe reaſonable Conditions, yet he offered the King to furniſh him with Proviſions for his whole Army, with ſhipping and all the Aſſiſtances, which he could wiſh from him, either by Sea or Land. And to make it appear, that he would perform, what he had promiſed, he writ to all his Officers in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> giving them Orders to furniſh the King libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally at the price Currant, during the whole time of the War in the Eaſt, with Arms, Horſes, Victual, and all manner of Proviſions, forbidding all manner of Perſons to hinder the tranſportation of them upon any pretext whatſoever. Theſe Letters, which were ſealed with the Golden <hi>Bulla</hi> of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and dated in the Months of <hi>Sptember</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> in the year 1246,

For it is impoſſible that there could be taken a more favourable Conjuncture, more juſt Meaſures, or more ſafe Precautions than thoſe which he took upon this occaſion, to make an Enterpriſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſucceſsful, to the Honour of <hi>France,</hi> without running any manifeſt hazard; an Enterpriſe wherein in thoſe times the greateſt Princes of the World thought the greateſt of their Glory did conſiſt.

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1246</label> had gained over the Princes of the League, over the Duke of <hi>Bretany,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and over the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Richard,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had indeavoured to ſupport the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and by a pretty piece of Policy he carried along with him all the Princes, and all the Great men of the Realm, who might give any Suſpicion, or the leaſt occaſion to fear, that they had either the Power, the Will, or the Temptation during his abſence to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Repoſe of his Dominions. For of the two moſt mutinous Spirits, of whom he had moſt reaſon to be diſtruſtful, he took one of them, which was the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> along with him; and the other, which was <hi>Raymond</hi> the Young, who was Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who had alſo taken upon him the Croſs, died before the Voyage, leaving his Dominions to <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> the King's Brother, the Count of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> who had married the Princeſs <hi>Joanna,</hi> his Daughter and Heireſs; and the King, for his greater aſſurance, ſent that Prince to eſtabliſh himſelf in his new Dominion of <hi>Languedoc</hi> before he imbarqued himſelf, as he afterwards did, to go and joyn him in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>Moreover he deferred his Voyage for almoſt four Years, to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of two fair occaſions, which preſented themſelves, the one to reunite the County of <hi>Maſcon</hi> to the Crown, which he bought of the Counteſs, who, after ſhe had diſtributed the money, for which ſhe ſold it to the poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the Nunnery of <hi>Maubuiſſon,</hi> and there profeſſed herſelf: the other was to bring the County of <hi>Provence</hi> into the Royal Houſe, which had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it for above three hundred Years. For <hi>Raymond Berenger,</hi> the Fifth of the Name, and the laſt of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Family, who had reigned in <hi>Provence,</hi> being dead the year preceeding, the King knew with ſo much Art how to gain <hi>Romee de Villeneuve,</hi> and <hi>Albert de Taraſcon,</hi> the Truſtees and Guardians of the Princeſs <hi>Beatrix,</hi> the remaining Daughter of the four, which Count <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> had had, who was Siſter to the Queen, and the Heireſs to the Count; that he obtained her for <hi>Charles d' Anjou,</hi> his Brother; and without loſing of time, advancing towards <hi>Provence</hi> with one part of the Army, which was ready for the <hi>Holy War,</hi> he broke all the meaſures of <hi>James</hi> the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> Couſin German to the deceaſed Count, and hindered his carrying the Princeſs away by force, as he had deſigned if he could not procure her by other wayes, in order to oblige her to marry his Son, and by that means to retain this fair County in his Family, which lay ſo conveniently for him. During this time <hi>Lewis</hi> had all the leiſure which could be reaſonably deſired to make his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and proviſions,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1247</label> which were the greateſt that ever had been ſeen; and alſo to ſettle that Publick Peace and Tranquility which he had ſo happily given to all his Dominions, and to aſſure himſelf on the ſide of <hi>England</hi> alſo. For he prolonged the Truce, which had been made with that King two or three Years before, after the Victory of <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> and alſo engaged the Pope to be the Guarranty that it ſhould be inviolably obſerved, as it was during all the time of his abſence, although the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearing of his being taken Priſoner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to break it. In ſhort, this Wiſe Prince neither went as the firſt <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades</hi> had done by Land, and thereby he avoided the dangers, into which they had fallen, of periſhing by Famine, and the miſeries which attended thoſe vaſt Deſert Countries, which were poſſeſſed by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> neither did he go with a confuſed Multitude of all manner of Perſons and People, who were to be gotten together, who ſerved for no other purpoſe, but to put all into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but with a good Army conſiſting in betwixt thirty and forty thouſand men, which was ſuch a number as the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> had when he went to the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia;</hi> but this Army was compoſed for the greateſt part of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and choice Souldiers, ſuch as were capable of marching over the bellies of all that <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> could oppoſe againſt them, unleſs ſome accident ſhould happen, or ſome extraordinary misfortune befal them, againſt which no humane Prudence can give any Warranty or Aſſurance. And that which was moſt conſiderable, the whole Army was abſolutely at his diſpoſal, in regard that it conſiſted wholly of <hi>French;</hi> for the King of <hi>England</hi> would not permit the Biſhop of <hi>Berytus,</hi> who went thither to preach the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> to publiſh it in his Dominions, alledging that he ſtood in need of all his Subjects to defend

                  <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> having wiſely provided all things neceſſary for his Voyage, which he undertook in his very prime ſtrength, being about three and thirty Years of Age, he had nothing further to do but to take care of the Government of his Realm in his abſence, and this he left to his Mother, Queen <hi>Blanch,</hi> the moſt able Woman, and moſt capable of Governing of any of her time; after which he went, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Ages, to St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> to receive the Oriſtame, the Scarf, and the Pilgrim's Staff, which he did in great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, for he parted from <hi>Paris</hi> upon the Friday after <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> in the year 1248. accompanied with the two Princes, his Brothers, the Legate,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1248</label> and the moſt part of the Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> being preceded by all the Proceſſions of the whole City, which were followed by an infinite number of People, who, all in tears, marched from the Palace to the Nunnery of St. <hi>Antonina,</hi> ſinging Pſalms and Letanies for the proſperity of his Voyage. From thence he went by <hi>Burgundy</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he made his Entry with all manner of Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for never any King was better acquainted with the Art of making his Royal Majeſty moſt conſpicuous in thoſe Publick Ceremonies, where he was minded to ſhew it; and the Hiſtorians of that Age inform us, that among other remarkable Circumſtances of this Magnificent Entry, there were an hundred Knights, who being compleatly armed, and mounted upon their great charging Horſes, capariſoned with their Coat Armor, according to the manner of thoſe times, marched before him with their Swords drawn in their hands; and this is that which our preſent King, who in Magnificience and Grandeur ſurpaſſeth all his Predeceſſars, hath revived in our dayes, to render to the Majeſty of our Kings, that which St. <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf, as great a Saint as he was, judged neceſſary upon ſome occaſions, for the manifeſting his Luſtre and his Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Holy King</hi> having again conferred with the Pope, who kept his Court at <hi>Lyons,</hi> deſcended by the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and went to take Shipping with the Queen upon the twenty fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at <hi>Aigues-Mortes,</hi> where the greateſt part of his Fleet waited for him, the remainder being at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> there to take in the reſt of his Army. After which ſetting ſail upon the twenty ſeventh, he arrived about the twentieth of <hi>September</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ships, which came from <hi>Aigues-Mortes,</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> ſooner or later, as the Troops came up, which were to be imbarqued upon them, came to joyn him in a little time after.</p>
                  <p>There it was that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> committed a great Error, which muſt not be diſſembled, and which moſt aſſuredly was the cauſe of his Misfortune, by following, againſt his own Judgment, the advice of the Lords of his Army, and the Barons of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> For one part of them being very glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, and the other to have time to prepare themſelves for the Voyage, which they promiſed to undertake with the <hi>French,</hi> and they lay ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at him, that they perſuaded the King contrary to his Inclination to ſtay in the Iſland till after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> pretending that the Winter was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and that it was moſt convenient to expect the coming up of ſeveral other Troops, which were to arrive; and this occaſioned two great Miſchiefs; For firſt, the Waters in the Iſland were nothing ſo wholeſome, as thoſe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and the Air was very bad, and not at all favourable to Strangers, who were not accuſtomed to it, by reaſon whereof Diſeaſes fell into the Army, and conſiderable numbers of them died, and divers even of the firſt Quality to the number of at leaſt an hundred and fifty, among whom were extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted, the Counts <hi>de Dreux, Vendoſme,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Montfort,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Beauvais</hi> and <hi>Noyon,</hi> and the Illuſtrious <hi>Archambaud de Bourbon.</hi> This is he, who was the laſt of the Race of the <hi>Archambauds,</hi> who having held, during the time of ſeven Counts of that name, <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Avergne</hi> for three hundred and eight years, loſt them happily for the Glory of that Houſe, by the Heireſs thereof, marrying into the Auguſt Race of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> there to revive again in the moſt glorious manner in the Deſcendants of that King, who are raiſed, as we ſee them at this day, with greater Splendour than ever, to one of the talleſt Thrones of Chriſtendom.

                  <p>The ſecond ill conſequence which this too long ſtay in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, was the leiſure, which was thereby given the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were then at War among themſelves, to reunite, or at leaſt to ſuſpend their private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, to put themſelves into a condition to oppoſe the Forces of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And in truth, when the King came to Land in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who ſometime before had ſeized upon <hi>Damaſous,</hi> and all the other Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans upon his hands, who were united againſt him for their common defence, and would not treat at all of any peace, as he deſired, unleſs he would firſt withdraw his Forces out of <hi>Syria.</hi> He was himſelf ſick at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and fearing that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army ſhould in the mean time fall into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was at laſt obliged at leaſt to obtain a Truce from the Sultan of <hi>Alepo,</hi> and to draw off his Army from before <hi>Emeſſa,</hi> which he had beſieged; ſo that if St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in ſtead of ſtopping in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> had gone directly to attack <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had found it without any Forces capable of reſiſting him, and might have made himſelf Maſter of it, with very little difficulty. Whereas during theſe ſix Months, which were ſpent unprofitably in this Iſland, the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> had all the time and opportunity, which he could deſire to accommodate matters with the Sultan of <hi>Alepo,</hi> and to recover of his Diſtemper; as alſo to draw his Army into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there to raiſe new Troops, and put all things into a poſture to receive the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> on the contrary, the King's Army was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weakned by this long time of lying ſtill; and beſides conſumed all the great Proviſions, which had been made; inſomuch, that unleſs the Emperor, <hi>Frederick,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to whom he made applications for Proviſions, which the Iſle could not furniſh him withal, and who ſerved him with it, in a manner infinitely obliging, had not furniſhed him, he had been conſtrained to return into <hi>France,</hi> without doing any thing at all.</p>
                  <p>It was during his ſtay in this Iſland, and towards the end of the Year, that he received from <hi>Nicoſia</hi> the Embaſſadors of one of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Princes, whoſe name was <hi>Ercalthay,</hi> and, who was then in the moſt Eaſtern Parts of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> After they had preſented their Letters of Credence, which were written in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language, and in <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, and tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> by Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who had formerly known theſe Ambaſſadors in <hi>Perſia,</hi> whither he had been ſent by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> they informed the King, that the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> had about three Years before been baptized, having been converted by the good Example and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of the Empreſs, his Mother, the Daughter of a King of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſhe having always been a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> That their Maſter, Prince <hi>Ercalthay,</hi> who had alſo for a long time been a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> had been ſent by the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> with a Potent Army againſt the <hi>Calife</hi> of <hi>Baldac,</hi> as great an Enemy of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the Sultan of <hi>Egypt.</hi> That that Sultan to afright the Sultan of <hi>Muſſule,</hi> or <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> who was alſo a Friend of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> had written to him, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> being come to attack <hi>Egypt,</hi> had been defeated at Sea, and had loſt above ſixty of his Ships, which had been carried in Triumph into <hi>Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> They added, that their Maſter had not doubted but that this Defeat by the

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1248</label> and that therefore having underſtood that a King ſo renowned throughout the World, was come to make War upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had ſent them to inform his Majeſty, that he was marching to beſiege the <hi>Calife</hi> in <hi>Baldac</hi> in the beginning of the Summer, and therefore requeſted him at the ſame time to attack <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that the Sultan and the <hi>Calife</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hindered from mutually aſſiſting the one the other, they might both of them with more eaſe come to the ends, which they had propoſed. All this, which theſe Ambaſſadors had related, and the account which they gave of the puiſſance of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> was exactly conformable to the Letters, which the Conſtable of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> who had made a Great Voyage into <hi>Tartaria,</hi> had before written to the King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> ſo that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> received them with an incredible joy,

After which he diſpatched them, loaden with Noble Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, together with Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and two other Religious of his Order, two Cordeliers, two Secular Eccleſiaſticks, and Gentlemen Attendants, whom he ſent Ambaſſadors, ſome to the Prince <hi>Ercalthay,</hi> and others to the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> with moſt Magnificent Preſents, both for the one and the other. There was ſent to the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> among other Rarities and curious Pieces of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, a moſt Sumptuous Tent of Scarlet, in form of a Chappel, where was to be ſeen in rich Embroidery, all the Myſteries of the Life and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, admirably repreſented in Silk raiſed with Gold, there was alſo belonging to the Chappel ſent all the neceſſary Ornaments and Furniture for the Celebration of the Divine Offices; as alſo to each of them a ſmall piece of the Wood of the Holy Croſs; and the King writ to them Letters full of the Spirit of Religion, with which his Soul abounded, in which he exhorted them to perſevere in the love of God, who by his Grace had been pleaſed to illuminate their Minds. and had called them to the happy knowledge of himſelf. The Legate alſo on his part did the ſame, writing to the Mother of the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> and to all the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of that huge Empire, exhorting them to take great care to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the true Faith, and the Unity of the Catholick Church, under the Obedience of the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Damiata,</hi> of which I have formerly given the deſcription, both as to its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and Strength, was at this time nothing ſo well fortified, as it was when about thirty Years before it was taken by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> after a Siege of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months; neither was it defended by ſuch gallant men as thoſe, who ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that long Siege; and the Sultan of <hi>Egypt, Melech-Salah,</hi> although he was a great Soldier, yet was much declined from his firſt Vigor, being in a weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, by reaſon of the great Sickneſs, which he had had during the Winter at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> Nevertheleſs, as he did expect, that the King would make his firſt attempt againſt the City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> which was the Key of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he brought thither all the Army, which came with him from <hi>Syria;</hi> and ſo ſoon as the Signal was given from the Tower of <hi>Pharus,</hi> that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet appeared, he ranged his Army along the Shoar, and cauſed his Ships and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64918:191"/>Gallies to deſcend to the Mouth of the <hi>Nile;</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1249</label> ſo that the firſt object, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Eyes of the <hi>French,</hi> were two great Armies, one by Sea, to oppoſe their Entry into the River; the other by Land upon the Brink of the Shoar to hinder their deſcent, from which two Armies they heard the terrible noiſe of their Inſtruments of War, and the dreadful ſhouts of ſo many millions of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> as made the Arched Roof of Heaven reſound again; the Sultan himſelf, as ill as he was, would put himſelf at the head of them, armed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely from head to foot in his faireſt Arms, all of fine Gold, and ſparkling with precious Stones, which receiving a marvellous reduplication from the ſhining Beams of the Sun caſt ſuch glittering Rayes, as made him ſeem all on fire.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the King held a Council with the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and <hi>William Hardoum,</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaia,</hi> who came from <hi>Morea, John d' Ybelin,</hi> Count <hi>de Jaffa,</hi> who was come from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and with the reſt of the Princes and Great Lords. They were all in the Opinion, that they ought not to endeavour a deſcent in View of two ſuch great Armies, they having not the third part of the number of their Enemies, and that they ought rather to expect the arrival of thoſe, who had been ſeparated by the Tempeſt, among whom there were above twelve hundred Knights, who were the choice men of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But the King maintained the contrary opinion, and made it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that if they deferred it any longer, they might put themſelves in evident danger of loſing all, in regard that they had no Port, to which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſecure themſelves from a ſuddain Tempeſt, which as it had done before, might chance to overtake them, and either ſeparate them, or force them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar upon the Enemies Coaſts. And that beſides this delay, would not only give the Enemies an increaſe of Courage, but the time to retrench themſelves with greater advantage. This reſolution of the King, and the Power of his reaſonings, having diſſipated the Fear, which they had, That they ſhould not ſucceed in their attempt with ſo ſmall a number, it was ordered that the next morning, they ſhould move directly againſt the Enemies if they ſhould again appear, to diſpute the deſcent the day following accordingly, being the Friday after <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> the greateſt part of the Knights and Soldiers, deſcending from the Ships in their Arms into the Shallops and flat-Boats, which were built in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> for the purpoſe, the King ranged them in two great Lines, which extended upon a long Front, to poſſeſs the whole length of the Bank, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Enemies ſtood in <hi>Battalia,</hi> in the ſame poſture as the day before, only the Sultan was not there, by reaſon that his ſickneſs increaſing, he had cauſed himſelf to be carried to a Country houſe, about a League from <hi>Damiata.</hi> The King was upon the right hand accompanied with the two Princes, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the other Princes, and the Flower of the Nobility and Knights, who encompaſſed him with their Boats; He was in his with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Legate, who himſelf carried his Croſs, which he held up aloft to animate the Soldiers by beholding the Saviour of the World repreſented, dying for them, and for whoſe ſake, they were going to expoſe their Lives. The Bark, which carried the Oriflame or Banner of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> went before all thoſe, which accompanied the King; The Count <hi>de Jaffa</hi> was upon the Left hand, drawing towards the Mouth of the River, and appeared at the head of his Veſſels, in a magnificent Galliot, painted all over with his Arms. And Count <hi>Errard de Brienne</hi> was in the middle of theſe two Squadrons, with <hi>Baldwin de Reims,</hi> who led a thouſand Gallant Knights.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Signal was given all theſe Veſſels began to row towards the ſhoar, and ſo ſoon as they approached within diſtance the Archers and Croſs-Bows, made a furious diſcharge to ſcatter the Enemy, who advanced to the Bank ſhooting without Intermiſſion from their ſide alſo; and at the ſame inſtant, ſooner or later found themſelves aground according as the Sea was deeper or ſhallower, in diverſe places to which they rowed, the Soldiers leaped out of the Boats, and advancing out of the Water upon the Sand, they drew up in their Battalions, covering themſelves with their Bucklers, and preſenting the points of their Pikes and Swords to their Enemies, who durſt never ſo much as once charge them. One of the firſt Barks, which landed, was that, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64918:191"/>the Banner of St. <hi>Dennis;</hi> which the King no ſooner perceived,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1249</label> but without ſtaying till they could run his Barge aground, and notwithſtanding all the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the Legate, who uſed his utmoſt Power to reſtrain him, he threw himſelf into the Sea up to the very Shoulders, his Shield hanging about his neck, his Cask upon his head, and with his Sword in his hand; he had in this Poſture advanced directly againſt the Enemy, if thoſe who crouded after him, had not in a manner by Force ſtop'd him till the Knights, who animated by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple precipitated themſelves overboard, with the deſire to come up to him, had put themſelves into order of Battle, as they did preſently after.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> whom thoſe, who were already landed, had beaten and repulſed twice or thrice, ſeeing that the whole Army began to move to charge them in good order, and that the King himſelf marched at the head of his Battalion, they no longer thought of ſighting, but after a faint reſiſtance, the Governour of <hi>Damiata,</hi> who commanded them, being ſlain upon the place, with two Admirals, and a conſiderable number of their men, they preſently fell to running with ſo much Precipitation and diſorder, that they had not time to break their Bridge of Boats, by which they entered into <hi>Damiata.</hi> And that which was ſtill more ſurprizing was, that they inſtantly quitted the City, which was one of the ſtrongeſt in all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after having ſet fire to the Magazins and Merchants Ware-Houſes, they marched out, and retreated towards <hi>Caire.</hi> And to compleat the good Fortune of this famous day, at the ſame time that the Army gained the ſhoar from the Enemy, and that they fought upon Land in this Heroick manner, the great Ships and the Gallies entring almoſt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance into the Mouth of the River, conſtrained the <hi>Saraſins</hi> Ships to ſave themſelves by Flight, as they did all, except thoſe, who having ſailed up the River as far as the Bridge, could not paſs ſo ſoon through the paſſage, which they had made, but that they were taken by the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in truth all this ſeemed to look like ſomething miraculous, to ſee a puiſſant Army, which conſiſted principally in Cavalry, routed in ſo ſhort a time by ſo few men, all on foot, and all moiled in the Mud and Water, ſo that they could not land, but in ſmall numbers, and had ſcarce time to draw themſelves up into ſome diſorderly Battalions; and that the Ships, in which there were ſcarce any beſides the Seamen, ſhould overcome and diſſipate a great Navy well armed; but above all, that one of the ſtrongeſt Cities of the Eaſt, which it was believed could never be taken but by Famine, ſhould immediately after be abandoned by men, who after all this were excellent Souldiers, and wanted neither Skill nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as had well been made appear both in <hi>Syria,</hi> and as too well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afterwards in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But beſides that they were amazed at the Courage of the <hi>French,</hi> and the ſurprizing Boldneſs of the King; and that God, as it may well be believed, poſſeſſed their hearts with that kind of Pannick fear, which makes valiant Men ſometimes loſe both their Judgment and their Courage; I find that a falſe Rumor, which was brought them of the Death of the Sultan, by ſome, who came from <hi>Caire,</hi> and which was believed to be true by both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies contributed much to this extraordinary Event; in regard that all the principal Officers, had an inclination to go directly to <hi>Caire,</hi> to take care of their particular Intereſts; in this great revolution of Affairs, which the Death of the Sultan would in probability make; ſo that they thought no longer of Fighting, or of keeping a City, which they choſe rather to ſet on fire, than to leave it intire to their Enemies. However it was, it is moſt certain that they did abandon it, and that ſo much of the Bridge of Boats, as their precipitation had given them leave to break, having been in a few hours repaired, a great part of the Army marched over and ſeized upon it, and having extinguiſhed the Fire, and cleanſed the Houſes, and put the great Moſquee into the condition wherein it was, when it was conſecrated to God in the Honor of our Lady, at the firſt taking of <hi>Damiata,</hi> thirty years before the King made his ſolemn entry into the City.</p>
                  <p>And certainly he did it in a manner, which evidently ſhewed, that he had an intention, that God alone ſhould have the Honor of the Triumph of ſuch a memorable Victory, which had not been gained, but by the extraordinary won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Power and his Goodneſs. For he commanded that the Croſs ſhould
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64918:192"/>enter firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1249</label> and ſhould immediately be followed by the Legate, the Patriarch, the Archbiſhops, the Biſhops, and all the Clergy ſinging Hymns in the praiſe of the great God of Armies: after which the King, accompanied with the Queen, the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Counts <hi>D' Artois</hi> and <hi>D' Anjou,</hi> marched bareheaded and barefooted with a profound Humility, giving all the Glory to God only: he was followed in this manner by all the Princes, the Lords, the Officers, and the whole Army, which afterwards continued there all the Summer, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, partly in the City and partly in the Camp, which he cauſed to be fortified againſt the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who indeavoured to ſurprize it. That which made him take this Reſolution was the fear of falling into a misfortune by the inundation of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> as the Chriſtian Army under King <hi>John de Brienne</hi> had done. But in regard that the River does not begin to ſwell till towards Mid-ſummer, if they had marched preſently towards <hi>Caire,</hi> and not deferred it to an unſeaſonable time, as they did afterwards, it is almoſt certain that in the diſorder, which the Sultans Sickneſs, and the defeat of his Army had occaſioned, they might have had time enough before the riſing of the <hi>Nile,</hi> to have taken that great City, which being not at all fortified, would upon its Reduction, have made them Maſters of all <hi>Egypt</hi> without ever drawing the Sword.</p>
                  <p>But it is the Misfortune which uſually attends Proſperity, which is apt ſo to Blind, and unbend Mens ſpirits, and to make them ſlacken their pace in the full Career of their purſuit of Glory, and then to ſtop, when they ought by acting moſt vigouroſly to ſeek that ſafe Repoſe, which is only to be had by going through with their great deſigns. The Pious King was not able to oppoſe the Torrent of Opinions, which ran ſo impetuouſly ſtrong for their ſtay at <hi>Damiata,</hi> under a hundred ſpecious pretexts, which were alledged for it; and during this ſtay ſo fatal to their Affairs, the Army not only waſted with this long idleneſs, but pulled down upon themſelves the juſt Vengeance of the incenſed Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, by all manner of diſſoluteneſs, and the moſt ſhameful and infamous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, into which both the Officers and Soldiers continually plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor was it poſſible for St. <hi>Lewis</hi> by his utmoſt Efforts to prevent them either by his Reproofs and Exhortations, by his orders, which were ill obſerved, of by the Puniſhments which he did inflict upon the Criminals, in baniſhing many Officers of his own houſhold from the Court, or even by that which is ordinarily moſt prevalent from Kings, by the admirable examples of all manner of Virtues, which upon all occaſions were ſo conſpicuous in his Life and Actions. At length, the Count <hi>de Poitiers,</hi> who had been ſo long expected, arriving about the end of <hi>October,</hi> with his Siſter-in-Law, the Counteſs <hi>D' Artois,</hi> and a great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reinforcement of the choice Gentlemen of the Arrier-ban, a Council was held, to conſider what enterpriſe was to be undertaken. And in this matter there were two Opinions, very remote and different. The firſt was maintained by the Duke of <hi>Bretany,</hi> who was of Opinion that they ought to Attack the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in regard that if they could take that place, they ſhould thereby become Maſters of all that ſide of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that they ſhould be Maſters of an admirable and ſafe Port for the Fleet to ride in; that they ſhould thereby have the great conveniency, not only of receiving the Succours of Men and Proviſions, which they ſhould ſtand in need of, but alſo be able abſolutely to hinder any from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Enemies by Sea. But the Count <hi>D' Artois</hi> declared himſelf for the ſecond Opinion, and ſtrongly argued, that as the certain way to deſtroy a Serpent was to cruſh his head; ſo to finiſh the Conqueſt of <hi>Egypt</hi> in a little time, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way was to march directly againſt <hi>Caire,</hi> which was the Capital City of the Realm. This advice, which ſeemed moſt plauſible, in regard it ſeemed to carry more Honor in it, was imbraced by all with great applauſe; and thereupon the King gave orders for the Army to march, which they did upon the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſhewed formerly that the <hi>Nilus</hi> entring into the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> a little below the <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> which is alſo the ancient <hi>Memphis,</hi> divides it ſelf into four Arms, which when this great River increaſes, as it doth certainly more or leſs every Year, from about the Feaſt of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, till towards the middle of <hi>September,</hi> it alſo makes ſeveral other great Channels, which remain dry when the Waters fall, and retire within their proper ſhoars, from whence as before

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1249</label> who frequently talk of the ſeven Mouths of the <hi>Nilus.</hi> The Ancient <hi>Peluſium</hi> ſtood upon the firſt of theſe Branches towards <hi>Paleſtine. Damiata</hi> was ſituate upon the ſecond Arm towards the left hand, about a good mile from the Sea; for as for the City of that Name at this time, it ſtands above two Leagues further up the River, and upon the other ſide; there is alſo a little City called <hi>Maſſora</hi> on the other ſide the River in the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> upon the Road that leads to <hi>Caire,</hi> in the place where this ſecond Arm divides it ſelf from the firſt. And this is the true ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe places, as appears evidently by the Conſequences of this Hiſtory; and that which hath occaſioned ſo much trouble in theſe matters, is the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Names, whilſt they give to the firſt of the Arms of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> that of <hi>Rexi</hi> or <hi>Roſſette,</hi> which at preſent is the Name of the Fourth, and was anciently called Canonique upon which <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſtands, as the ſecond upon which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata</hi> was ſituate was called the Tanitique.</p>
                  <p>It was near the Angle which the parting of theſe two Armes of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> formed near <hi>Maſſora,</hi> that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> were incamped with all their Forces, commanded by the <hi>Emir Secedun Faroardin,</hi> the moſt renowned and braveſt of their Captains, to whom the Sultan <hi>Melech-Salah,</hi> who was almoſt ready to breath his laſt, had intruſted the Government of all his Dominions, and the Conduct of his Army againſt the Chriſtians, in expectation of the return of his Son <hi>Almoadam,</hi> whom he had ſent into <hi>Syria</hi> to raiſe new Troops. The Kings Army which had received a reinforcement of the Troops of the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Achaia,</hi> of all the Forces of the <hi>Templers</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> together with thoſe brought by the Patriarch, and the Arrierban of <hi>France,</hi> which the Count of <hi>Poitiers</hi> had happily conducted to <hi>Damiata,</hi> conſiſted in ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, whereof there were twenty thouſand Horſe; theſe were as many as were ſufficient to have conquered the Realm of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if they had been as well diſciplined, and as obedient to the Orders of the King, as they were brave and reſolute. But every one was for acting according to his own Opinion; and St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who together with his Devotion had as much Courage and Reſolution, as was capable of making him like a Hero deſire to combate his Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of the greateſt dangers, either had not power or ſeverity ſufficient to make himſelf be obeyed, and to cauſe the diſcipline of War to be exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Army therefore Marching over the Bellies of all thoſe who preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe them or moleſt them in their paſſage, and the Knights of the <hi>Temple</hi> having cut in pieces five hundred <hi>Saraſin</hi> Horſe, who pretending to come over to the King, had a deſign treacherouſly to ſurprize his Perſon, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtmas came to incamp in ſight of <hi>Maſſora,</hi> over againſt the Army of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> the River only parting them, but which could not hinder the Chriſtians from the Reſolution of paſſing it, that ſo they might come to a Battle with them. It is certain that there was commited a ſecond mighty Error; for whereas they ought to have ſounded the River above and below to have found ſome Ford, as King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young had done at the Famous paſſage of the <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> they indeavoured to make a Cauſway, over this Arm of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and to turn the courſe of the River, that ſo they might gain a free paſſage for the Army. For this purpoſe they built great Wooden Towers with ſeveral ſtories of Stages, upon which the Crosbows and Archers were placed; there were alſo Wooden Caſtles, and covered Gallies built for the defence of the Labourers; and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Machins, the Invention of <hi>Joſſelin Courvaut,</hi> a great Ingeneer of that time, were framed in the manner of a Counter Battery, to oppoſe ſix great Machins of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> which did terrible Execution upon the Army; but after they had ſpent near two Months in theſe Works, with the loſs of a great many Men,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> they found themſelves no further advanced than at the beginning; for the Enemies ruined more in one day, than could be repaired in five, and all the Machins were either broken by their Slings, which diſcharged againſt them ſtones of a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bigneſs, or elſe burnt by the <hi>Greek</hi> Wild-fire, which was diſcharged upon them in a moſt dreadful manner. For theſe Fires which were with an extreme violence thrown from a certain kind of Sling through their Pipes, which were almoſt as large as our Canons, appeared in the Air like flaming Dragons of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64918:193"/>bigneſs of a Barrel with a long train like a Rocket,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> which making a noiſe like thunder, and afterwards falling down, darted themſelves againſt the Men and the Engines with the ſame impetuoſity, as one ſhall ſee the Waves of the Sea, during a Tempeſt, daſh themſelves one after another againſt the Rocks which lie upon the Shoar; inſomuch that nothing was able to reſiſt the furious outrage of this Fire, which in a moment conſumed whatſoever it met withal; ſo that they now deſpaired of making their paſſage by theſe wayes, when chance preſented them with that which they ought long before to have found out by their own diligence and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>For at length the Conſtable <hi>Imbert de Beaujeu,</hi> acquainted the King that an <hi>Arabian,</hi> who had deſerted the Enemies, offered to ſhew them a Ford ſomething below the place where they were incamped, provided they would give him five hundred <hi>Beſants.</hi> The Condition was immediately accepted, and the <hi>Arabian</hi> was aſſured of his Reward, if his Promiſe proved true, and thereupon it was reſolved, trial having been made, that the next Morning, being Shrove-Tueſday, one part of the Army ſhould paſs the Ford, whileſt the other guarded the Camp againſt the Enemies, who had the paſſage open on the other ſide, and thereby might fall upon them in the Reer. The King with the three Princes, his Brothers, reſolved to be of the number of thoſe, who were to paſs the Ford, whileſt the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> remained to guard the Camp. The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early the Troops were divided into three Bodies; the Vanguard was given to the <hi>Templers, Robert</hi> Count <hi>d' Artois</hi> lead the Body of the Battle, and the third the King reſerved as the Reerguard to himſelf, commanding the Troops, as they landed on the other ſide, to draw up in the ſame manner. In this Order they marched along the River, deſcending to the Ford, which was found very dangerous and more difficult than they believed, there being in it ſeveral places ſo deep, that the River being high, they were forced to ſwim. However they paſſed it without loſs, in the view of three hundred Horſe, who made ſhew as if they would defend the Paſs; the <hi>Templers</hi> being in the Van, according to the King's Orders, drew up firſt in Battalia, and ſtopped in expectation of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the reſt. But the Count <hi>d' Artois</hi> was no ſooner got to the other ſide of the River, but that ſeeing the <hi>Saraſins</hi> fly, he galloped in purſuit of them, with his whole Brigade at full ſpeed. The <hi>Templers,</hi> who could not indure to be put out of the Port, which the King had aſſigned them, cried out to them to halt till the reſt of the Army was drawn up, but all was to no purpoſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that a ſtout old Knight, whoſe Name was <hi>Fouquant de Melle,</hi> to whom the King had committed the charge of the Count <hi>d' Artois,</hi> being deaf, underſtood not what they meant, but on the contrary cried out with all his might, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Count, <hi>Fall on, Fall on, the Day is our own.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Templers</hi> loſing all their patience, and believing their honor would ſuffer, if they did not advance, ſpurred up after the Count, without ſtaying till the King was paſſed, and charged with the firſt, even to the Camp of the Enemies over againſt the Cauſway, in the place where all their Machins were, upon which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeized.</p>
                  <p>But they were not ſatisfied with this, for ſeeing that thoſe who guarded them, being ſurprized with ſuch a brisk Attacque, which they did not in the leaſt expect, fled towards <hi>Maſſora,</hi> they followed them at full ſpeed, and paſſing after them quite throw the Town, into the Champion, upon the Way to <hi>Caire,</hi> never conſidered the danger to which they expoſed themſelves, of being ſurrounded by the groſs of the Army, which advanced from the other ſide of the City, to fall upon their Reer. And thereupon the Fugitives perceiving their diſorder, and the ſmall number of thoſe, who ſo blindly purſued them, and ſeeing themſelves ſuccoured by their Men, who advanced to their relief, they faced about, and ſtopped the Purſuers, conſtraining them to think of a retreat. But it was now to late, for when they thought to repaſs thorough the Town of <hi>Maſſora,</hi> they found all the ſtreets poſſeſſed, and ſtopped by the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who having ſurrounded them on every part, and diſcharging upon them from the houſes, as at a certain mark, they were almoſt all Slain, the Count <hi>d' Artois</hi> himſelf fell there alſo, after he had for a long time defended himſelf in a Houſe which he had gained and Barricado'd againſt the Enemy, and with him <hi>Raoul de
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64918:193"/>Couci,</hi> and above three hundred Knights with their Attendants,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> as alſo two hundred <hi>Templers</hi> there loſt their lives, after having made a wonderful Slaughter among the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> both in the Field and in their Camp. The Great Maſter of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who made a ſhift to diſingage himſelf from his Enemies, yet loſt one of his Eyes in the Encounter; and <hi>Peter,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretany,</hi> with ſome others who fought like Lions after his Example, retreated from this Slaughter all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Wounds and Blood, which iſſued in great quantity from his Mouth; the Seneſchal <hi>Joinville,</hi> and the Lords, <hi>Hugh de Trichasteau, Peter de Neville, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oul de Vanon, Erard d' Eſmeray, Hugh</hi> of <hi>Scotland, Renaud de Menoncour,</hi> and a few more, who were not got over when the Count ran upon the Enemy, were inveſted with above ſix thouſand <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who coming from all quarters char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them moſt furiouſly; and after having ſlain the Lord <hi>de Trichaſteau,</hi> and wounded almoſt all the reſt, they were juſt upon the point of taking them all Priſoners, when they were ſtopped by the relief which the Count <hi>d' Anjon</hi> brought to their aſſiſtance, and in a moment after forced to retire to the groſs of their Army, there appearing to them a mighty Cloud of duſt, which riſe from the Neighbouring heights, from whence alſo was to be heard the fearful Noiſe of Trumpets, Cornets, Drums, Flutes and Fifes, mingled with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Horſes, and the ſhouts of War, like thoſe of Men, who were going to the charge; which made them imagine that all the Chriſtian Army was ready to fall upon them.</p>
                  <p>And in truth, it was St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who having underſtood the diſorder of his People, was advancing to their aſſiſtance, with all his Men at Armes, and had made a halt upon that eminence, to give out his Orders according to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein he ſhould find his own Men and the Enemies. There was never any thing that appeared more beautiful and withal more formidable than this Prince, ſo ſoon as this Cloud of duſt which covered him was diſſipated. For whether it were that his charging Horſe, was really larger than any of his Guards, or that he raiſed himſelf upon his ſtyrops, to ſpeak to his Men, and to incourage them in this dangerous occaſion, or that God was pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Majeſty in this great Day, and to make him appear taller than he was, it is certain, that the Sieur <hi>Joinville,</hi> who ſaw him in this condition from the plain where he was, aſſures us, that he ſurpaſſed all the Knights that were about him by the Head and Shoulders; it was in this poſture that having his head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Golden Cask, a mighty <hi>German</hi> Sword in his hand, his Shield upon his left Arm, an aſſured countenance, and a Noble Fire ſparkling from his Eyes, which pierced the hearts of his Souldiers, communicating ſome part of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Flames to every one that ſaw him, he ſo animated his People, that many gallant Men, without ſtaying for the Command, flew to charge theſe ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were retreating; and they alſo receiving them like Valiant Men, and, contrary to their cuſtom, Fighting Foot to Foot, there never was ſeen in all theſe Wars a more furious Combate than this, which was maintained with mighty blows of the Sword, the Mace, and Battle Ax.</p>
                  <p>The King, who beheld this great Combate, tranſported by a generous impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to come to blows, was upon the point of ſpurring up after his Men, to throw himſelf into the midſt of his Enemies; but <hi>John de Valery,</hi> one of the wifeſt and moſt experienced Knights of his time, remonſtrated to him, that it was not there that the affair was to be decided; but that there was a neceſſity to draw up in Battalia, more to the Right hand along by the River, that ſo he might not be ſurrounded by the Enemy, who without this precaution might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fall upon his Rear; and that alſo by this means he might receive ſuccour from his Forces which were on the other ſide of the River with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who now having no Enemy at their Head might have time enough to lay over a Bridge. And the event preſently ſhewed that this was wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who after the defeat of the Count <hi>d' Artois,</hi> and the <hi>Templers</hi> no longer doubted of the Victory, came all together to attack the King, whom they would eaſily have encompaſſed with their innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if he had not been ſecured by having the River at his back. The Combate was long and bloody, and the Enemies charged at firſt with ſo much Vigor, and gave ſuch a furious Volly of Darts and Arrows, that many of the Kings People
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64918:194"/>believing all was loſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> thought baſely, how to ſave themſelves by getting back again over the River, but with the ill fate of Cowards, who commonly find their Death by flying, they unhappily in their amazement miſtook the Ford, and ſo were drowned. But the invincible courage of the King, and the Heroick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which upon this occaſion he performed, again eſtabliſhed all, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Fortune at laſt to declare in favour of Vertue. For having overthrown the Enemies, and with his Sword in his hand charged into the thickeſt of their Battalions, he preſently drew after him, by the greatneſs of the danger to which he expoſed himſelf, and by his example, all the Lords and Knights, who were about his Perſon, and who all of them ſhewed prodigious effects of Valour, but yet not comparable to thoſe, which this Noble King performed; for being got mingled with the thickeſt of his Enemies, at ſome diſtance from his Men, ſix of the braveſt of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> fell upon him, and laid hold of the bridle of his Horſe, to carry him away by Force, before he could be reſcued; but he diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf from them all by his own ſingle Valour; and by the blows which he beſtowed among them, for he overthrew one with his Buckler, and ſpurring his Horſe againſt a ſecond, laid Horſe and Man upon the Ground, a third he ran quite through the Body, and with a dreadful reverſe made the Head and Cask roll from the ſhoulders of a fourth, and one of them ſtill hanging upon his Bridle he cut off both his hands at the wriſts, and ſo paſſed over the Bellies of them all, ſtill purſuing his point and advancing, as reſolved either to vanquiſh or to die; ſo that if it had been a private Souldier, who had ſo bravely acquitted himſelf, he muſt have been eſteemed an extraordinary Prodigy of Courage and Valour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe great Actions, did ſo increaſe the Courage and Strength of all his Men, that after they had for three hours after Noon ſuſtained the utmoſt Efforts of ſo many thouſands of Enemies, who believed they ſhould eaſily Triumph over ſo ſmall a Number, they conſtrained them to recoil, and, at laſt, after they had in vain attempted to regain their advantage, to draw off towards the evening, leaving to the Conquerors their Machins and their Camp, upon which the Count <hi>d' Artois</hi> had ſeized at the beginning of this Famous Battle. The Slaughter was great both on the one ſide and the other, but eſpecially of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who left among the Slain, with which the whole Field was covered, the Valiant <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin</hi> their General, and divers of their Admirals, who were ſurprized and ſlain in the Camp. The King with thoſe few Men, who eſcaped this bloody Day, lodged himſelf near the Machins, which had been taken, and which the brave <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher de Chaſtillon,</hi> to whom the King gave the Guard of them, preſerved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Attempts which the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were poſted cloſe by, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, under the ſavour of the darkneſs, to recover them.</p>
                  <p>The two following Days were imployed in fortifying the Camp, and paſſing over the greateſt part of the Troops, which were in the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s Camp on the other ſide the River, and certainly this diligence was no more than neceſſary; for the King was advertiſed by his Spies, upon the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the evening, that he, who ſucceeded <hi>Fracardin,</hi> was reſolved to attack the Camp the next morning with their whole Army, which had received a great reinforcement from <hi>Grand Caire.</hi> For this new General, whom the <hi>Saraſins</hi> had choſen for his extraordinary Valour and admirable Conduct, having cauſed to be carried round the Camp upon the top of a Lance, the Coat of Arms of the Count <hi>d' Artois,</hi> which was richly Embroidered with his Arms, the <hi>Flowers de Lys Or,</hi> cauſed it to be Proclaimed, that it was the King himſelf, who was ſlain, and that the Chriſtian Army being in the utmoſt Conſternation after the loſs of their King, and ſo many gallant Men as were ſlain in the Battle, they ought to Attack them inſtantly in thoſe feeble retrenchments, without giving them leiſure to recover or to ſave themſelves. The <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who believed that they were to be led to a certain Victory, and to the Booty, rather than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, by their great ſhouts of Joy, witneſſed, that they were ready to march againſt the Enemy; and accordingly it was reſolved, that they ſhould go the next Morning to attack the Chriſtians in their Camp.</p>
                  <p>The King, who had received this advice, made very good uſe of it; for having diſpoſed all things during the Night for the receiving the Enemy, he cauſed the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64918:194"/>Army to diſloge about break of Day, and divided it into eight Bodies,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> which he placed in Battalia before the Retrenchments, which lay all along the bank of the River, the Army was drawn up all upon one line, that ſo they might poſſeſs the whole length of the Camp, and make head againſt the Enemies in all places, if they ſhould attack them on all ſides at once, as by reaſon of their infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude it might very well be imagined they would. The Count <hi>d' Anjou,</hi> who commanded the firſt Body, was upon the Right hand, above the River, towards <hi>Caire;</hi> and had a this left, <hi>Guy d' Ibelin</hi> the Conſtable, and <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Brother, High Steward of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who lead the Auxiliaries of that Kingdom. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Gaucher de Chaſtillon,</hi> followed with the third Body, compoſed of the brave Nobility and Gentry of <hi>France. William Sonnac,</hi> Great Maſter of the <hi>Temple,</hi> made the fourth, with the little remainder of his Knights. <hi>Gui de Malvoiſin,</hi> one of the ſtouteſt Knights of the Army, led the fifth. The Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> was with his Body poſted in the place where the Retrenchments turned towards the River, to ſecure the Camp on that ſide. <hi>Joinville,</hi> Seneſchal of <hi>Champagne</hi> was upon his left, drawing down to the River, and the Count <hi>de Poitiers,</hi> who was next him, appeared alone upon Horſeback, at the head of a great Battalion, which made the laſt of the Bodies, to whom <hi>Joſſerand de Brianſon,</hi> who came along with him, joyned himſelf with twenty of his Knights, who fought that Day on Foot: ſo that the two Princes, the Brothers of the King, had the two Wings of the Army.</p>
                  <p>The General of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who obſerved it, and who was a great Captain, ranged his Men alſo according to the order of the Kings Army, and extended himſelf upon two great lines, which anſwered to the length of the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He placed all his old Souldiers upon the firſt, dividing them into ſo many Battalions, which were ſuſtained by his beſt Horſe, which were drawn up in a ſeparate Body before the Army. All his Battalions were incomparably ſtronger than the Chriſtians, and he ſtrengthened them more or leſs according as he obſerved the oppoſite Battalions, which they were to encounter, were Stronger or Weaker. For as for Cavalry the <hi>French</hi> had but a few, the greateſt part of the Horſes having been either killed or wounded in the laſt ingagement. Upon the ſecond Line he ranged an infinite number of new Troops, which were come to him from <hi>Caire,</hi> and all the upper <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Armies ſtood thus facing one another till about Noon, when the <hi>Saraſins</hi> began to move from all p arts, and with dreadful ſhouts mingled with the ſound of an infinite number of Drums, Trumpets, and Cornets, they charged upon all the <hi>French</hi> Battalions all together, with ſo much Fury, that thoſe, who had for a long time been acquainted with the Wars in the Eaſt, aſſure us, that they had never ſeen the like in all the Battles, wherein they had fought againſt the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> For at the ſame time that ſome of them diſcharged their Darts and Arrows, in infinite Numbers, to diſorder the Chriſtians, the firſt Ranks of their Infantry, running in to them, threw from their long Braſen Pipes, their dreadful Wild-fire among them to break their Ranks; and at the ſame time the Cavalry, which followed them, indeavoured to enter by the breaches, which the Fire had made, and to hinder the Souldiers while they were buiſy to ſecure themſelves from the Wild-fire, from cloſing their ranks and getting into order again.</p>
                  <p>The Battalion of the Count <hi>d' Anjou</hi> which received the firſt charge from the left Wing of the Enemies, and was at firſt ſo diſordered, that the Souldiers not being able to rally again preſently, that Prince was in great danger either to be ſlain or taken by the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> The King, who was in the middle of his Troops, to give the neceſſary orders for all things, being advertiſed of the extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Brother, did an Action, which it will be very difficult to find one to equal it, even among the moſt boaſted Actions, of the ſo much celebrated Heroes of Antiquity. For he had no ſooner received the News, but without deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Moment, and without ſtaying to give out his Orders, or even ſo much as commanding any to follow him, he ran to his relief, and ſpurring his Horſe at full ſpeed towards the Battalion of the Count, breaking throw the Crowd, he threw himſelf with his Sword in his hand, like Lighting into the middle of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were carrying off the Count, wounding, overturning, and trampling under his Horſes feet what ever oppoſed his paſſage, laying about him
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64918:195"/>on both ſides upon the Inſidels with his terrible Sword,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> whoſe furious blows made Heads and Arms fly off at every ſtroak, receiving himſelf alſo a thouſand blows of the Sword and Mace upon his Cask and Shield; till at laſt he forced his paſſage through all the Darts and Wild-fire, which on all ſides were Lanced at him, and came up to his Brother and diſingaged him from his Enemies. After which being ſeconded by that brave Prince and his Men, who animated by the ſight of this Prodigy of Valor, were now become quite other Men, he repulſed, routed, and at length put to flight the remainder of the Enemies, who oppoſed him, after ſo great an Action.</p>
                  <p>But that which was ſtill more odd, was, that the Count <hi>de Poitiers,</hi> his other Brother, who fought upon the Left, againſt the Right Wing of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> had at the ſame time a Fortune much reſembling that of the Count <hi>d' Anjou,</hi> but a deliverance from his danger in a manner wholly different. For the Enemies having overthrown him; as they had done his Brother, defeated his People, who were all Infantry, and forced the Camp on that ſide, making the Count a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; they were now leading him away, without any hopes of his being relieved by the King, who could not work the Miracle after thoſe others he had done to be preſent in two places at one time. Thereupon the Sutlers, the Grooms, and Servants, who were all Armed, and even the Women, who followed the Camp to ſell Proviſions, not contenting themſelves to cry out for help, ran upon their Enemies with ſo much reſolution and charged them ſo furiouſly, the Men with Swords, the Women with great ſtones, that they drive them out of the Camp, and followed them ſo cloſely ſtill beating of them, till they came up to thoſe, who were carrying away the Prince; they preſently cauſed them to quite their Prize, and conſult their ſafety by running away, and he thereupon inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rallying his Battalion, marched to ſuſtain theſe brave Sutlers of the Camp. And certainly the Courage and Valor, which ſo much to their Honour they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted upon this occaſion, makes it evident, that provided they have heart and Reſolution, the moſt Heroick Actions may ſometimes be performed by all ſorts of Perſons, of what Quality or Profeſſion ſoever, nay, even by the weaker ſex, ſince Virtue makes no diſtinction among ſuch as follow her, with equal Courage and Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The Fortune of the Knights of the <hi>Temple</hi> was not altogether ſo good; for there being but a few of them left after their defeat in <hi>Maſſora,</hi> and their weak Retrenchments which they had made of the Planks, which they had pulled off from the Engines, which had been taken from the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> being quickly burnt by the <hi>Greek</hi> Wild-ſire, they were ſo overpowered with the multitude of their Enemies, that they were almoſt all cut in pieces, together with their Great Maſter, who having loſt his Eye in the firſt Battle, loſt his Life alſo in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But at laſt all the other Bodies were Victorious, and conſtrained their Enemies, after a moſt bloody Combate, to retire and leave behind them a great number of their braveſt Men dead upon the place; and to the Chriſtians the Glory to have gained the Day without Cavalry, and for the moſt part without defenſive Arms, in regard, that the Wounds, which they had received in the firſt Battle, would neither permit them to put on their Curiaſſes, nor to indure to Fight on Horſeback, and in ſhort to have vanquiſhed them upon ſuch great diſadvantages, repulſing ſo many Horſemen, who were well Armed, againſt whom they fought.</p>
                  <p>This was what King <hi>Lewis</hi> took notice of to his Lords and to the principal Officers of his Army, thereby to raiſe their Courage and their Hope; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the plain truth was, that as on the one hand they did not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a condition to attack thoſe Enemies whom they had with difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed; nor able to force them, ſo as to March againſt <hi>Caire;</hi> ſo on the other, a longer ſtay in the place where they were incamped, was but daily to weaken themſelves, and to give the Enemy the leiſure to fortifie themſelves, they ought therefore after theſe two Victories to have retired to <hi>Damiata,</hi> and not to have ſtayed ſo long, till it was impoſſible for them to make a ſafe and honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. But ſo it was, that they ſtayed there all the Lent; whilſt in the mean time the new Sultan <hi>Almoadan Caiatadin</hi> arrived at <hi>Maſſora</hi> with a puiſſant Army, which he brought with him from the Eaſt. This redoubled the Courage of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64918:195"/>
                     <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who, to let the Chriſtians underſtand their Arrival,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> received them with all the Teſtimonies of rejoycing. And on the contrary all ſorts of misfortunes came rolling one upon the neck of another, to the diſadvantage of the Chriſtians, who were not able to guard themſelves againſt them. For the infection of the dead Bodies which they had thrown into the <hi>Nile,</hi> and which after the breaking of their Galls, floated again upon the Water, and were ſtopped at the Bridge, which was made for the Communication of the two Camps, putrefying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Air, and filled the Camp with diſeaſes; and above all the Scurvy in that moiſt Country ſeized upon the Souldiers, inſomuch that there was ſcarcely a Tent, wherein every Day there was not found ſome Perſon either Dead or Dying. The Veſſels alſo which brought Proviſions from <hi>Damiata</hi> to the Camp, by the way of the Sea and the River, were all taken by the Sultan's Gallies, who poſſeſſed themſelves of all the paſſages of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> both above and below. Two great Convoys alſo, which came by Land, were intirely defeated by great parties of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who continually ranged the Campaign, to hinder any thing from coming to the Army. So that all Proviſions being thus cut off, abundance pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed moſt miſerably by Famine; and they were reduced to feed upon certain Fiſhes of the <hi>Nilus,</hi> which being fed with the putrid Carcaſſes of the Slain, Poiſoned rather than nouriſhed, ſuch as were forced to live upon ſuch corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed food.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, to compleat the Misfortune, the King himſelf was ſeized with this Diſeaſe of the Camp, ſo that in concluſion the Army after having in vain ſo obſtinately and long conteſted with ſo many Evils, was obliged to reſolve upon a Retreat, which certainly in the condition wherein they were, was impoſſible, and which two Months before, they might have hoped to have done with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It is true, that before this there had been ſome overtures of a Peace or Truce between the Commiſſioners of the King, and thoſe of the Sultan, and that it proceded ſo far that the King was to ſurrender <hi>Damiata,</hi> and that the Sultan alſo ſhould yield to the Chriſtians all the Places which he held in the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But it appeared plainly, that this was not propoſed by the Sultan, but to amuſe the King; for he had the confidence to demand that, which there was no probability that it ſhould ever be condeſcended unto, which was that for the ſecurity of the Treaty, the Perſon of the King ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him as an hoſtage. Whereupon one of the Commiſſiones, <hi>Geoffrey de Sergines,</hi> one of the wiſeſt and moſt Valiant Knights of that Age, briskly broke up the conference, proteſting that the <hi>French</hi> would chuſe rather to be cut all in a thouſand pieces, than to indure being always ſubject to the intolerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of having given the King of <hi>France</hi> for an Hoſtage, or to owe their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuch a baſe and deteſtable ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore upon a Tueſday, the fifth of <hi>April,</hi> that the Army attempted to retreat in view of an Enemy, whoſe Forces were infinitely augmented by the conjunction of new Troops, which he had received from time to time, from all parts of his Empire. All was done that could poſſibly be repreſented to the King to oblige him conſidering his Sickneſs, to go before the Army, and ſave himſelf as did the Legate, and divers Biſhops, who went off in a great Gally, which breaking through the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> arrived ſafe at <hi>Damiata.</hi> But he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, proteſting that he would dye a thouſand times, rather than aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo many Gallant men, who had ſo generouſly expoſed their Lives for his, and the Service of God. Thus by his orders, they began in the Evening to imbark the Sick and wounded upon thoſe Veſſels, which were come up the <hi>Nilus,</hi> for the Service of the Army, when they approached <hi>Maſſora;</hi> and for himſelf taking his way by Land, he put himſelf with <hi>Geoffrey de Sergines,</hi> into the Reerguard, which was led by the brave <hi>Gaucher de Chaſtillon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly it was impoſſible, without running the danger of loſing all, to make a movement before an Enemy, who was ten times ſtronger, and who only watched for this opportunity, to fall upon an Army already half overthrown by Famine and Diſeaſes; and in truth they followed them ſo quickly, that they had not ſo much time as to deſtroy the Bridge, but that the Enemy paſſed it almoſt as ſoon as the Reerguard were got over, whileſt that a Party of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> falling into the Camp, pitileſly cut the throats of all the Sick and Wounded,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:64918:196"/>who waited upon the bank of the River,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> for the Veſſels that were to take them in. After this there was nothing to be ſeen throughout, but a fearful diſorder, which was followed by the moſt intire and lamentable loſs, that any Hiſtory ever gives a Relation of; for on the one part, of all the Veſſels which went down the <hi>Nilus,</hi> to ſave themſelves by Sea at <hi>Damiata,</hi> there were only a few Boats, which ſecured themſelves under the favour of the Legate's great Gally, which opened her way by the Force of her Oars; all the reſt were either taken or burnt by the Saltan's Fleet; and one might hear the piteous cries of the Poor Sick Men, who not being able to throw themſelves into the River, to yield themſelves to the Enemies by Swimming, were miſerably conſumed by the Flames, whileſt the greateſt part of thoſe who could get out of the burning Veſſels, either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Waters, or were ſlain by the <hi>Saraſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, thoſe who went by Land, finding themſelves preſently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by an infinite multitude of Enemies, were ſo vigorouſly at tacked on all ſides, that after having in vain done all that was poſſible to defend themſelves, and to make way through ſo many Battalions, and Squadrons, as invironed them, they were either all taken or Slain, not ſo much as one eſcaping. There it was, that <hi>Guyde Chaſtell</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> upon the <hi>Marne,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> a moſt Valiant Man, who choſe rather to die by this kind of Martyrdom in a <hi>Holy War,</hi> than to be taken Priſoner, threw himſelf ſingle, his Sword in his hand, into the midle of a Squadron of <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who preſently gave him that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Death, which he ſought among a thouſand Swords, in Fighting againſt the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Greeks</hi> indeed are often uſed to reproach us, that our Prieſts and Biſhops make no ſcruple of going to the Wars and Fighting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Canons, which prohibit them under moſt rigorous penalties, to manage Arms; and I muſt acknowledge that there have been great diſorders in this particular among us in former Ages, and that the Popes have frequently complained of it to our Kings. But in theſe times of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors believed well, that the Canons did not extend to theſe <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> to which when the Eccleſiaſticks had devoted themſelves, by taking up the Croſs, as well as the Laicks, it was permited them to fight againſt the Infidels; and eſteemed as Lawful as for a Shepherd, who leaves his Flock to purſue the Wolves if he can to kill them.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it known that for this they ever abſtained from the exerciſe of their ſacred Function; witneſs the Valiant Chaplain of the Lord <hi>de Joinville.</hi> He was a Prieſt and conſtantly officiated for his Maſter, but that nevertheleſs did not hinder him, but that Armed with a Curiaſs, and his Head covered with an Iron Cask, his Sword in his hand, he went and attacked ſix Captains of the <hi>Saraſins</hi> ſingly, in the ſight of both the Armies, and beat them all, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the beholders, who could not but praiſe his Courage, and his bravery. This makes it clear, that the Canons and the Councils, which are the Laws of the Church, ought to be taken and interpreted according to the uſage which they permit or tolerate. However it be, the Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> believed that inexpoſing himſelf in this manner to a certain Death, he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Crown of Immortality, both in fame upon Earth and in Heaven; nor ought it reaſonably to be doubted but that he did.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time <hi>Gaucher de Chaſtillon,</hi> his kinſman, who Commanded the Reer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, performed an Action of the like extraordinary Merit, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Honor of Poſterity, the Recompence of Heroick Actions, of which it may be, his was one of the greateſt that was ever done. For having poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the laſt Man, in a narrow paſſage, through which the King was to go, to gain a little Village called <hi>Kaſel;</hi> he alone for a long time ſuſtained the ſhock of all the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> upon whom, facing about, he threw himſelf like Lightning, killing and ſlaying, all thoſe whom he could overtake; and then, after he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them a while, making his retreat, whileſt he received their Arrows and their Darts, upon his Shield, his Curiaſs, and his Body, which was all briſtled with them, he would return again upon his Enemies with greater fury than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and every time as he charged, raiſing himſelf upon his Styrrops, he cried amain, <hi>Follow</hi> Chaſtillon, <hi>Follow</hi> Chaſtillon, <hi>my Noble Knights! Where are all our gallant Men?</hi> And thus he maintained continually this ſtrange kind of Combate,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64918:196"/>wherein he was ſingly againſt them all,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> till ſuch time as being oppreſſed with the throng of his Enemies, who yet were not able to diſmount him, they wounded him with a thouſand Swords and Javelins, and at laſt cut of his head, as he ſtill ſate upon Horſeback. Thus heroically died this brave Lord, in the eight and twentieth year of his Age, ſacrificing ſo great a Life, worthy of a much better deſtiny, with ſo much Courage for the ſafety of the whole Army, which nevertheleſs he could not ſave by his glorious Death. For this Obſtacle being removed, the <hi>Saraſins</hi> purſued their Victory ſo eagerly, that they came up even to the Perſon of the King, whom the Faithful and Valiant <hi>Geoffrey de Sergines</hi> covered with his Body, and with his Sword in his hand, made thoſe ſtand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, who had the conſidence to approach him. But in concluſion, all that they could do, whileſt they did to no purpoſe perform the braveſt Actions in the World, was to Conduct the King into <hi>Kaſel,</hi> and it being impoſſible there to defend him againſt the whole Army of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> which had already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the reſt of the Troops, and the Life of the King being in great danger, who was reduced to that condition by his Sickneſs, that he ſeemed to be in the laſt extremity, a Herauld, either of his own accord, or by order, having Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that they ſhould lay down their Arms, and not expoſe the Life of the King, all yielded, and ſubmitted themſelves to the diſcretion of theſe <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who did not fail accordingly to make a moſt Barbarous uſe of their Victory.</p>
                  <p>For immediately, without Mercy or Compaſſion, they cut the throats of all the Sick and Wounded, which they found in the Army; and then having ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all the Perſons of Quality, the Captains and Officers, from the private Souldiers, and the Servants, they did upon the ſpot, cut of the heads of all the laſt, who had the conſtancy to refuſe renouncing of Jeſus Chriſt, making ſo many Martyrs, as there were Chriſtians thus brutiſhly Murdered. As for the Perſons of Quality, who were Priſoners, the Covetouſneſs of the Infidels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing over their Cruelty, they ſpared their Lives, in hopes to draw from them, conſiderable Sums of Money for their Ranſoms: but they treated them in their Impriſonment in a worſe manner, than the moſt unfortunate Slaves are wont to be uſed among Chriſtians; and that they might make them ſuffer in their Souls as well as Bodies, they vented before them a thouſand Blaſphemies, and committed a thouſand outrages againſt the Croſs, thereby to diſhonour that adorable God and Man, who was Crucified upon it. And that which was moſt ſurprizing in this Rencountre, and which ought to ſerve the Chriſtians with an excellent inſtruction, which God was pleaſed to give them from the Mouth of one of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which will one day confound them, if they do not change their ſuperſtitious ſentiments, was, That an old <hi>Saraſin</hi> Lord, who, by the richneſs of his habiliments, and by the great train of Armed young <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> who accompanied him, appeared to be a Perſon of the firſt quality among the Infidels, coming into the Pavilion, where moſt of the Lords were put, grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded of them by an Interpreter, if they believed really that their God was made Man, and that he had ſuffered Death for them upon the Croſs, and that he was raiſed from the Dead after three Days? All the Lords, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they ſhould inſtantly be made Martyrs, upon their frank confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, anſwered with one Voice, and without the leaſt heſitation, <hi>That this was their firm belief. If it be ſo Meſſieurs,</hi> replied the Wiſe <hi>Saraſin, comfort your ſelves in your Affliction, you have not yet ſuffered Death for your God as he hath done for you; and ſince he had the Power to raïſe himſelf again, you ought alſo to believe, that having had ſo much kindneſs for you, and having ſo much Power, he will very ſpeedily deliver you out of your Captivity and Miſfortunes.</hi> And thereupon without ſaying any more he inſtantly withdrew. And in truth he could not have ſaid a greater thing. For certainly it is all that can be ſaid to Chriſtians, to give them the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſolid conſolation, in the greateſt of all adverſities, which may befal them, in this Mortal State. And this was it without doubt this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thought, in which <hi>Lewis</hi> had been long confirmed, and from whence this Holy King drew that incomparable conſtancy of Mind, which made him appear greater in this Gulph of his Miſfortunes, into which he was plunged, than ever he had appeared upon his Throne in <hi>France,</hi> in the faireſt day of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64918:197"/>after ſo many Victories as had laid all his Enemies under his Feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> The firſt thing which he did, after he was come out of the long Swound, into which his weakneſs and the pain of his Diſeaſe had thrown him, and in which it was thought he would have expired, was to ask of one of his Chaplains for the Book of his Prayers, which he preſently ſaid for that day, with the ſame Peace and Tranquility, that by cuſtom he had acquired, as if he had been in his Oratory at <hi>Paris.</hi> He praiſed God with all his Soul, that he was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for his ſake, and reſolved that he would do nothing for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the prejudice of his Honor or his Conſcience, or diſadvantageous either to his Realm, or to the Affairs of the Chriſtians in the Eaſt. It is true that at firſt the Sultan, either that he was moved with Compaſſion for the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to which he ſaw ſo great a Prince reduced, or rather that he feared to loſe his Ranſom, treated the King with great Humanity, and gave Order that he ſhould be ſerved with all manner of Care and Honor, ſending to him the moſt able of his Phyſicians, who being acquainted with the Nature of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, with which he was afflicted, in a few days put him into a condition quite out of danger. But the Infidel ſoon returned to his own Natural Barbarity, and ſeeing that the King conſtantly refuſed to ſurrender any of thoſe places, which the Chriſtians held in <hi>Syria</hi> and in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo brutiſhly tranſported as to threaten to put him to the Bernacles, which was a kind of moſt cruel Torture, which the <hi>Saraſins</hi> made uſe of to Torment their Enemies, or their Criminals withal, by diſlocation of all their Bones.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſaw that this admirable Prince received all his Menaces with a generous diſdain, and without Emotion; and that he remained fixed in his firſt Reſolution, he treated him more reaſonably, and cauſed it to be demanded of him, whether beſides <hi>Damiata,</hi> he would give a Million of Byſances of Gold for his Ranſom. The Lord <hi>Joinville</hi> reduceth it in his Hiſtory to five hundred thouſand Livres, which in my Opinion, ought to be underſtood of ſo many Crowns in Gold, for there is no manner of probability, that a Byſance of Gold, which was a conſiderable Price, as appears in all Hiſtorians, ſhould be of no greater value, than ſix pence of our Money. To this the King anſwered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, with a Marvellous greatneſs of Soul, that he would give that Million for the Ranſom of the Priſoners, and <hi>Damiata</hi> for his own, in regard, he ſaid, it was diſhonourable for a King of <hi>France,</hi> to buy himſelf with Silver. This ſo ſurprized the Sultan, who like a Merchant had demanded much more than he thought ought to be given, to come at laſt to the finiſhing of a bargain, that he cried out, that the <hi>French</hi> King was too Free and Generous, ſo ſoon to agree to pay ſo great a Sum, upon the firſt demand, and that he would quit him of one hundred thouſand, and content himſelf with four of the five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livres.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Treaty was quickly concluded, by which it was agreed, <hi>That there ſhould be a Truce for ten Years; That all the Priſoners which had been taken on either ſide in</hi> Egypt <hi>or in</hi> Syria, <hi>as well thoſe which had been taken ſince the Truce, which the Emperor</hi> Frederick <hi>had made with Sultan</hi> Meledin, <hi>as thoſe which had been taken ſince the Arrival of the King in</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſhould be ſet at Liberty; That the Chriſtians ſhould peaceably poſſeſs all the places which they held in</hi> Paleſtine <hi>and</hi> Syria; <hi>That the King ſhould pay eight hundred thouſand Byſances of Gold, for the Ranſom of all the Priſoners, and ſurrender</hi> Damiata <hi>to the Sultan for his own; That all the moveables which the King, the Princes, the Lords, and in general all the Chriſtians, ſhould leave in</hi> Damiata, <hi>ſhould be there ſecured by a Guard from the Sultan, till ſuch time as the King ſhould ſend ſhipping to tranſport them whither he pleaſed; That all the Sick, and thoſe who had any Affairs at</hi> Damiata, <hi>might remain there in ſafety, till they were in a condition to be removed; And that then they might with Freedom retire whither they ſhould pleaſe; And that the Sultan ſhould give thoſe, who went by Land, a Convoy, until they arrived at ſome place in the Poſſeſſion of the Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being agreed, the Sultan ſent to the King the two Counts, his Brothers, all the Princes and Great Lords upon four Gallies, which fell down the River to a certain Place, where there was a Wooden Palace, built for the Sultan, upon the Bank of the River, and a Magnificent Tent erected, where the King and this Prince had an interview, in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> about a Week before Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64918:197"/>Day; where after having reciprocally confirmed the Treaty,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> the King promiſed the Sultan, that within three days he would ſurrender <hi>Damiata</hi> to him: Inſomuch that now there ſeemed to be nothing which might hinder or retard the Liberty of the King, when upon a ſuddain their happened a ſtrange Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which overturned all; and as an unexpected Tempeſt happening at Sea, forces out a Ship when ſhe is juſt ready to drop her Anchor, and happily to enter into the Port, ſo this unforeſeen Accident, which in a moment changed the Face of Affairs, ruined all the fair hopes of the approaching deliverance of the King, and did not only plunge him again into the ſame Afflictions, but put him into the manifeſt danger of loſing both his Liberty and his Life. The manner of this change was thus.</p>
                  <p>The Sultans of <hi>Egypt</hi> had for their Guard a great Body of <hi>Militia,</hi> of ten or twelve thouſand Choice Men, much like which we have ſince ſeen, and which to this day continues among the <hi>Turks,</hi> compoſed of Tribute Children, of which thoſe who are looked upon as moſt proper to be made Souldiers, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Military Diſcipline, and inrolled among the Guards of the Prince, which are called <hi>Janizaries.</hi> For the Sultans cauſed to be bought in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and eſpecially in the Countries which lie between the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and in the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> great numbers of Slaves, and reſerving the luſtieſt young men, and the Children of thoſe who were born to theſe Slaves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after having cauſed them to be carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all Military Skill, they placed them into this Body of Souldiers of their Guards, which were called <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies Servant or Slave, and in regard that they were bought with the Sultan's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and knew no other Maſter, they were intirely at his devotion. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as theſe <hi>Mamalukes</hi> made themſelves conſiderable by their gallant Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they were advanced in their Charges, and made either Captains of Troops, or Governours of Cities and Provinces, which in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language were called <hi>Amir,</hi> or <hi>Emir,</hi> and which the Writers of thoſe Times have expreſſed by the Term of Admiral, which we have borrowed from the <hi>Saraſins;</hi> and it is fit to advertiſe the Reader, that one of our Writers, hath had the confidence to affirm, that we make uſe of that word upon this occaſion, out of Ignorance; when in truth, he himſelf was ignorant of the true Original of the Word, and was not acquainted, that all the Learned World have conſtantly uſed it in this ſence, giving indifferently to theſe ſort of Perſons the Title of <hi>Emir, Amir,</hi> or, as it is expreſſed in <hi>Latin,</hi> Admiral, as in the <hi>Greek</hi> alſo, as may be ſeen in all the Hiſtorians of thoſe Times. But it was ever thus, that they who ſee the leaſt are the moſt confident in pronouncing their deciſive opinion; for having but a ſhort ſight, which yet in their opinion is very good, they have not ſo much as the Art of thinking or doubting there may be ſomething which at preſent they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do not diſcover, or cannot ſee.</p>
                  <p>Now the laſt of the Sultans, taking notice of this powerful Body of theſe <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> who were the braveſt Souldiers of the Eaſt, began to ſtand in fear of their Captains; and for this reaſon, when any one of them grew Rich, or very conſiderable for ſome great Action, they did not fail under ſome pretext or other to take them out of the way of their Jealouſie; thus the deceaſed Sultan <hi>Mclech-Salah-Nayem-Addin,</hi> put to death the Admirals, who at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Gaza</hi> had taken the Counts <hi>de Bar</hi> and <hi>Montfort.</hi> His Son <hi>Almoadam Gaiat-Addin</hi> returning from the Eaſt to take poſſeſſion of his Empire, had at his firſt coming to the Crown, by this wicked and to him unfortunate Policy, taken the Principal Charges from all the Ancient Admirals, the Captains of the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> and had conferred them upon thoſe Strangers, whom he brought along with him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> This did ſo furiouſly provoke the Captains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that fearing, leſt being now ſo firmly eſtabliſhed by his Victory over the <hi>French</hi> Army, and the recovery of <hi>Damiata,</hi> he ſhould follow the Example of his Father, and put them to Death; they reſolved to be beforehand with him, and to cauſe him to be ſlain by the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> who they were aſſured were at their devotion; and accordingly the next day, after he had conferred with St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> his own Guards ſet upon him juſt as he roſe from the Table after dinner, and when he indeavoured to ſave himſelf in the higheſt of the three
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64918:198"/>Towers,

After which, one of theſe Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners having pulled out the heart of this miſerable Sultan, had the brutiſh impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to enter into the King's Tent, and in ſhewing it to him, to ſay, <hi>What wilt thou give me as a reward for having ſlain thine Enemy, who, if he had lived, would have done the ſame to thee?</hi> To which St <hi>Lewis</hi> made no other reply, but by a Look, which made him know, that he had a horror for this execrable Parricide.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the greateſt part of theſe Murderers, following the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, entred like ſo many unchained Furies, with horrible Cries, and dreadful Menaces, their Eyes ſparkling with rage and fury, and with frightful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in which was painted the lively Image of their Crime, they all together preſented the points of their naked Swords to the Throat and Breaſt of this admirable Prince; who without the leaſt ſign of aſtoniſhment, and without loſing any thing of that Royal Air which inſpires the moſt barbarous Perſons with reſpect for Sacred Majeſty, appeared ſo reſolute, and eaſie in the middle of theſe Savage Beaſts, as if he had been among his Barons. And whether it pleaſed God, who governs all hearts, ſuddainly to ſweeten thoſe of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and to calm the ſtorm of their ſury; or that theſe Admirals were unwilling to loſe the benefit of their Crimes, by loſing the Ranſom of the King, which they might divide among themſelves, they proceeded no further than to Menaces, thereby to oblige him immediately to ratifie the Treaty which he had made, and preſently to put <hi>Damiata</hi> into their hands. At the ſame inſtant their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who acted by agreement with them, uſed the Princes and the Lords, who were aboard the Gallies, at the ſame rate; ſo that they believing, when they ſaw them come ruſhing in upon them with their Swords in their hands, that they ſhould all be preſently butchered by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> they all fell upon their knees to confeſs themſelves to an Eccleſiaſtick, who belonged to the Earl of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Sire de Joinville</hi> ſaith, that as he was holding his neck ready for theſe hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Steward of <hi>Cyprus Gui d' Ibelin,</hi> who believed alſo that he was going to Execution, confeſſed himſelf honeſtly to him; and he adds very ingeniouſly, that in good faith he gave him the beſt Abſolution that he could, giving him all that God had given him power to give; but tells us that he could never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one word of what the <hi>Cypriote</hi> confeſſed, ſo was he prepoſſeſſed, and taken up with the thoughts of that death which he ſaw preſent before his Eyes. But all this was done by the <hi>Emirs</hi> for no other reaſon, but to gain by theſe Menaces, the preſent ratification of the Treaty, which lay cloſe to their hearts in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great Sum of Money which they hoped to get before there ſhould be a new Sultan.</p>
                  <p>The King, who had reſolved to ſurrender <hi>Damiata</hi> for his Ranſom, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he found by the Opinion of all the Lords of his Council, that it was abſolutely impoſſible to keep it in the condition wherein his Affairs then ſtood, anſwered coolly to the Admirals, that what he had once agreed ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and that he was ready to renew the Treaty with them, which he had before made with the Sultan. Whereupon it was again concluded upon the ſame conditions on one ſide and the other, only with this addition, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King parted from the River, he ſhould pay two hundred thouſand Livres to the Admirals; That the Count</hi> de Poitiers <hi>ſhould remain their Priſoner at</hi> Damiata, <hi>till the whole was paid; That for the ſecurity of the payment of two hundred thouſand Livres more, they ſhould keep the Sick, the Munitions, the Arms, and the Machins, till ſuch time as the King ſhould diſcharge this Sum in the City of</hi> Acre. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing now to be done, but to confirm this Treaty by a Solemn Oath on the one part and the other, as the Admirals deſired. They made theirs in the ſtrongeſt terms, in which it could be made according to their Law; but when according to the Counſel which was given them by ſome Renegado's, they would have impoſed upon the King a dreadful Oath, conceived in theſe Terms, <hi>That in caſe he ſhould fail in the accompliſhment of his Promiſes, he would be reputed perjured; as a Chriſtian who had renounced his God, his Baptiſme, and his Goſpel;

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> he had ſuch a horror for theſe fearful Expreſſions, that he proteſted he would ſooner loſe his Life than wound his Conſcience by taking ſuch an Oath. There were however learned men, and Perſons of Authority, who maintained that he might with a ſafe Conſcience take it, provided, that he was reſolved to perform in reallity all that he ſhould promiſe. The Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo, whom the Admirals had already cauſed to be tied to a Stake to torment him, becauſe they believed that it was he who had put this Scruple into the King's mind, cried out to him, that he ſhould boldly take the Oath, and that he would be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for, all that was criminal in it; ſo did likewiſe one Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the City of <hi>Acre,</hi> who was very much eſteemed by the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> in whoſe Cuſtoms and Language he was very skilful, and of whom they made uſe in ſuch occaſions, as his induſtry might be ſerviceable to them; and he told the King plainly, to perſwade him to it, that if he did not take this Oath, the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> were reſolved to cut off his Head, and thoſe of all the other Priſoners. But all this was not able to ſhake the conſtancy of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who would by no means expoſe himſelf to the danger of committing what he thought ſo black a Crime; but anſwered, with an admirable reſolution, That they might do what they pleaſed, as for his own particular, he would never do a thing of that Nature, which was againſt his Conſcience. Whereupon the <hi>Emirs,</hi> admiring the greatneſs of his Soul, were ſo far from doing him any outrage, that they ſubmitted with reſpect, and receiving Law from him, ſatisfied themſelves with ſuch an Oath as he was pleaſed to take. This ſhews us with how little light of Judgment and Integrity, the Proteſtant <hi>John de Serres,</hi> hath in his Hiſtory recorded, as an undoubted Truth, one of the moſt improbable Fables that ever was invented, when he tells us that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> for the ſecurity of his Promiſes pawned to theſe <hi>Emirs</hi> the Box wherein it was kept, and the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. For what appearance is there that this Holy King, who choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die than to take an Oath, which he believed was contrary to the Law of God, although he was aſſured that he might do it with a ſafe Conſcience, would thus throw Pearls before Swine, and deliver Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by a faith ſo lively to be preſent under the Species of that adorable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and like <hi>Judas</hi> put him once again into the hands of his mortal Enemies, to be expoſed to thoſe Outrages and Indignities which they might offer. And in reality with all my ſearch I could never find, nor can there one ſingle witneſs be produced of ſuch an Extraordinary Action, nor among all the Authors of that time, any one Writer be found, who hath ſaid the leaſt thing upon which it is poſſible to lay the Foundation of ſuch a groundleſs Calumny. The Pledges which St. <hi>Lewis</hi> gave for the ſecurity of the two payments, are poſitively told us. <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> Count <hi>de Poitiers</hi> his Brother, for the firſt; all the Sick, all the Munitions and Engins for the ſecond; that there is neither neceſſity, room, nor one word concerning the Holy Sacrament. How then can he dare to aſſure us that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> left it in pawn with the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> A Modern Writer ought to ſay nothing of the Ages paſt, but upon good Warranty from the Records of thoſe Times for what he writes; for otherwiſe he is ſo far from being a good Hiſtorian, that he becomes a paltry Romancer and Inventer of Fictions. And herein <hi>du Haillan</hi> is excuſable, who having given this Account in a few words, adds very honeſtly, that there is no certainty of this Story. And the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Tyre, Heroldus,</hi> another Proteſtant, is much an honeſter man, when he tells us plainly, that all this is a meer Fable, which hath been raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an ill grounded conjecture, as many learned Perſons have obſerved; For by reaſon that after this the <hi>Egyptians</hi> cauſed a Chalice with the <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented upon their Money, their Tapiſtry hangings, and their Publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſome have conjectured, that the reaſon was in commemoration, that St. <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> had left there the <hi>Ciboir</hi> or Box, and the conſecrated <hi>Hoſtia:</hi> But from whence can one draw this untoward conſequence? or is it therefore that conjectures, and ſuch feeble conjectures as this muſt be impoſed upon us for Truths in Fact, that men take the liberty to publiſh them, as things of the greateſt certainty? If conjectures be of any value, it is more reaſonable and natural to ſay, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did this, as in Triumph, and that theſe were the Publick Trophies and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64918:199"/>Marks of the Victory,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> which in defeating the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, they believed they had gained againſt the God of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who was adored in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and to whom they knew very well that St <hi>Lewis</hi> did moſt aſſiduouſly pay his duty with an infinite reſpect. And this is the more credible, in regard that this great Prince after his return into <hi>France,</hi> carried money to be minted, whereupon was to be ſeen <hi>Manacles,</hi> to ſhew his impriſonment, and thereby to animate the <hi>French</hi> one day to revenge upon the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> the Injuries and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages which they had received from them during their Captivity.</p>
                  <p>I have thought it neceſſary, in ſhort, thus to refute this groſs miſtake, that ſo I might prevent many, and ſome even among the Catholick Writers, who have ſuffered themſelves to be miſerably deceived, and who have miſled others in relating a thing ſo little credible, upon the bare word of <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> who is their only Warranty for it in the firſt Book of his Elogies, which he hath written of illuſtrious men, in that of <hi>Saladin.</hi> And yet even this Author ſaith no more, but barely without quoting any Perſon, <hi>That it is reported that St.</hi> Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is <hi>gave him for a pledge the Holy Sacrament.</hi> And ſo little doth he know what it is that he ſays, that in the ſame place he adds, that it was to <hi>Saladin,</hi> or as he believes it is moſt probable, to his Brother <hi>Saphadin</hi> that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> gave this Pledge. Whereas it is of publick notoriety in Hiſtory, that theſe two Sultans were dead, the one above fifty, the other more than thirty years before the War, which St. <hi>Lewis</hi> made in <hi>Egypt.</hi> How can any one then pretend to be ſo far in the Right, I do not ſay to aſſure it, but even to relate upon the Authority of a Modern Hiſtorian of ſo little exactneſs and fidelity, as <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> a thing ſo little probable, and ſo highly injurious to one of the greateſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction one of the holieſt Kings of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But further, all the <hi>Mamaluke</hi> Admirals, and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> themſelves were of a quite different opinion, and could not imagine that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> was ſo cowardly, as at laſt to reſolve to give them for an Hoſtage, the Euchariſt which he adored, after that <hi>Geoffrey de Sergines</hi> had proteſted, as he did before them all, that they would all chuſe to periſh rather than give the King himſelf in Hoſtage, as the Sultan had demanded. For they were ſo ſmitten with the bright luſtre of the Royal Vertues of this great King, and with that Majeſty with which he treated them, as if they had been his Subjects, and indeed his Priſoners, as they would ſay themſelves in admiration of the ſtrength of his Mind, the greatneſs of his Soul, and his Heroick Courage, that one day in ſounding before his Pavilion, in honor of him all their Trumpets and Warlike Inſtruments, they had it under debate, whether they ſhould chuſe him for their Sultan; and there was nothing that obſtructed it, beſides his immoveable Reſolution to do nothing which might in the leaſt ſhock his Religion, the Exerciſes whereof he would perform aloud like a Maſter, and as if he were aſſured, that they durſt not ſo much as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thought of oppoſing him; ſo that they were uſed to ſay, <hi>That he was the moſt Fierce Chriſtian, that they had ever ſeen.</hi> And one may from hence well judge, whether after this theſe <hi>Emirs</hi> would have the Confidence to demand from him to put that into their hands which they knew he acknowledged to be, and worſhipped as true God. And that which was yet moſt admirable in this adventure, was, that this Holy King demanded ſometime after of the Lord <hi>De Joinville,</hi> what his opinion was in this matter, and ſuppoſing the Admirals ſhould offer him the Crown, whether he ſhould accept it? to whom the good Seneſchal, after his manner anſwered very bluntly, <hi>That he ſhould be a very fool to accept it, and truſt himſelf to theſe Villains, who had murdered their Prince.</hi> And I, anſwered the King, <hi>For my part, I declare to you, that I would never have refuſed it.</hi> And this without doubt proceeded from the pleaſure with which he was raviſhed, to have ſo fair an opportunity of ſacrificing himſelf, by accepting this Empire, for the re-eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had ſometimes flouriſhed by an infinite multitude of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, in the firſt Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty being thus at laſt confirmed by all parties, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King ſurrendred <hi>Damiata,</hi> upon the Friday after Aſcenſion-Day, and was at the ſame time ſet at Liberty himſelf with all the Priſoners, ſo far, as that the four Gallies fell down the River to the Bridge of <hi>Damiata,</hi> into which
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:64918:199"/>place <hi>Geoffrey de Sergines</hi> entred, early in the Morning,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> to deliver it into the hands of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> after he had drawn out all the <hi>French,</hi> together with the Queen, who after the Impriſonment of the King, had been reduced to great extremities. For ſo ſoon as ſhe received the ſad news, ſhe fell into ſuch an exceſſive grief, that believing ſhe was upon the point of falling into the hands of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> ſhe threw her ſelf upon her knees, before a Knight of fourſcore years of Age, who never forſook her, and obliged him to promiſe her with an Oath, to grant her one requeſt, which ſhe deſired him to do for her; and this was, that if the <hi>Saraſins</hi> took the City he would cut off her head; the Old Knight promiſed her he would, adding with great frankneſs, that before ſhe had done him the Honor to deſire it of him, he had already reſolved to do it, thereby to put her into a place of ſecurity, and out of the Power of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> The Extremity and Violence of her grief, brought her alſo into her Travail three Days before her time, and ſhe was delivered of a Son, to whom they gave a Surname, drawn from her Affliction, calling him <hi>Triſtan,</hi> as being in truth the true Son of her Sorrow. And upon the ſame Day underſtanding that the <hi>Piſans,</hi> the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and all the reſt of the People were reſolved to abandon the place, fearing the Siege, and Famine, ſhe prevailed ſo far upon them with her Prayers, and Tears, that they were contented to ſtay, ſhe promiſing to furniſh them with Proviſions at her own Charges, which ſhe did at the Expence of above three hundred thouſand Livres.</p>
                  <p>At length the Queen, the Legate, the Biſhops, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who retired thither in a good hour, together with all the Garriſon, which was Commanded by <hi>Oliver de Termes,</hi> imbarqued upon the Ships which expected them below the Bridge, and ſteered away directly for <hi>Acre,</hi> according to the Order of the King; and the <hi>Saraſins</hi> entred into <hi>Damiata,</hi> where preſently mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Drunk with the Wines they found there, they moſt brutiſhly ſlew all the Sick, and fired the Machins, which according to the Treaty they were to ſurrender. But the Admirals did far worſe, for inſtead of delivering the King and the Priſoners, ſo ſoon as <hi>Damiata</hi> was put into their Poſſeſſion, they put it under deliberation, Whether they ſhould not rather cut all their throats; and one among them maintained, that having committed ſo great a Crime againſt the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as they had done in killing their Sultan, they ſhould yet commit a greater, as he ſhewed them out of one of their Books, if they ſhould ſuffer the greateſt Enemy of their Law, to eſcape with his Life out of their hands. And the matter went ſo far, that the four Gallies rowed up the River till they came within a League of <hi>Caire,</hi> inſomuch that all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, except the King, whom they Guarded in his Pavilion upon the Bank of the River, had now loſt all manner of hopes of Life or Liberty. But at laſt the better Opinion prevailed, and there were ſome among them who urged vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that if, after having ſlain their Sultan, they ſhould again imbrue their hands in the Blood of one of the greateſt Kings in the World, after having given their Faith to him, by ſuch a Solemn Treaty; they ſhould paſs through the whole Earth, for the moſt infamous, and the moſt abominable of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but to ſpeak truth, I am rather of an Opinion, that the eight hundred thouſand Byſances, which they would have loſt by committing ſuch a horrible Crime, without any manner of advantage, was the weight which turned the Scale, and was the ſtrongeſt reaſon to perſwade them, for this time at leaſt, to be honeſt, and to keep their Word and their Oath. And this informs us, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is the beſt Guarranty of any Treaty, being the thing which hath more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over moſt People, to oblige them to ſtand to their agreements, than all the Oaths, and all the Hands and Seals which they can give.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, after two and thirty Days Captivity, the King, all the Princes, and the Lords of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and of the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the poor remainder of Soldiers, which there was left after ſuch a terrible defeat, wherein there were loſt near thirty thouſand Men, were ſet at Liberty, the Count <hi>de Poitiers,</hi> only excepted, who was kept at <hi>Damiata</hi> for the ſecurity of the firſt Payment, and the ſame Evening the King was Conducted by twenty thouſand <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who to do him Honor, Marched on Foot, to a large <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Gally, which attended him below the Bridge, and upon which he imbarqued

In <hi>Germany</hi> a Troop of Vagabonds, mingled with young People, and the Scum and Refuſe of the Peaſantry, ran all over, crying that they muſt make a <hi>Cruſade</hi> for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Ring of <hi>France.</hi> And a certain <hi>Hungarian</hi> Apoſtate, of the Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Order, one of the moſt proſligate Villains in the World, but very able and Learned in many Languages, put himſelf at the head of them, and undertook to be their Captain Conductor. For this purpoſe he paſſed into <hi>France,</hi> with his Company, and fell to Preaching as if he had been a Prophet, and publiſhed this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> as he ſaid from God Almighty, for the deliverance of the King, telling of a world of Miracles, Viſions and Revelations which he had, eſpecially from the Bleſſed Virgin and the Angels, which theſe ſimple well meaning People, eſpecially the Countrymen and Shepherds, looked upon as the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God.</p>
                  <p>For he ſaid himſelf, and cauſed it to be Preached alſo by his Impoſtors, whom he ſent abroad, that Jeſus Chriſt, who was the good Shepherd, and Innocence it ſelf, was reſolved to make uſe of Shepherds, and the good innocent Country People for the deliverance of the beſt King in the World. And herewith he aſſembled an infinite number of young People, Shepherds and Peaſants, who, leaving their Teams and their Toils, their Flocks and Herds, took upon them the Croſs, and took up Arms; all the Rabble joyning with them under this new head of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> thereby to gain their Liberty under ſuch a ſpecious pretext, as this of the deliverance of the King. And in truth it was an Army of Villains, of Thieves, Murderers, and Sacrilegious Wretches, which was divided into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, who had a Lamb painted in their Colours, which gave occaſion to their name of <hi>Shepherds.</hi> He alſo himſelf created Captains among them, who were called Maſters, to whom he gave the Sacrilegious Licence, to exerciſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal and Pontifical Functions: ſo that they undertook to bleſs the People, giving remiſſion not only for Sins already committed, but ſuch as ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the future, making Marriages and Divorces according to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, committing a thouſand other Sacrileges, and above all, declaring War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prieſts and Monks, whom they cruelly Murdered, alledging they had drawn down the indignation of God upon the People, and were by their diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lives the cauſe of the King's Misfortunes and Captivity.</p>
                  <p>The People at firſt were ſo Sottiſh as to favour theſe new <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, committed infinite diſorders. Thoſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> were ſo ſilly as to permit them to do what they pleaſed in their City, where they put all the Clergy to the Sword. They would have done the ſame at <hi>Berri,</hi> where they began to Plunder; but they found there ſome People too Wiſe and Courageous to endure it. For after they had been driven out of <hi>Bourges,</hi> where they thought to have done the ſame they did at <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Berri</hi> took Arms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Commons, and purſued theſe Robbers, and overtaking them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Mortemer</hi> and <hi>Villeneuve</hi> upon the <hi>Char,</hi> they cut the greateſt part of them in Pieces, together with their Apoſtate General, who was ſlain upon the place. The remainder of this Rout, who ſaved themſelves by Flight, and all that could be found of them in the other Provinces, periſhed ſhortly after, either by the Halter, or by the hands of ſuch as followed the Example of theſe brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Berri,</hi> to whom the Queen <hi>Regent,</hi> was obliged for the Tranquillity, which they reſtored to the ſtate in the abſence of the King, who in this time was buſie in the Affairs of the Realm of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which he did after his Arrival at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> was to deliver all the <hi>Saraſin</hi> Priſoners according to his Promiſe, and to ſend Men and Ships into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bring the Chriſtian Captives from thence, according to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well thoſe, who were taken laſt, as thoſe who had been made Priſoners after the Truce of the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> with Sultan <hi>Meledin,</hi> who had ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly expoſed their Lives and Liberty, for the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt. But theſe perfidious Admirals, who already repented, and reproached their own folly as they called it, in letting ſo great a King eſcape out of their hands, could
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64918:202"/>never be perſwaded to reſtore more than four hundred,

It is reported alſo, that they did moſt inhumanely cauſe the Eyes of three hundred of the moſt Noble and braveſt among the other Captives to be put out, before they ſent them back to the King, thereby to put them out of a condition of ever being able to bear Arms againſt them any more. And it was, as it is credibly believed, in Memory of theſe three hundred blind Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> afterwards founded the Famous Hoſpital of the fifteen ſcore at <hi>Paris,</hi> as it is declared in the Bulla which Pope <hi>Sixtus Quartus,</hi> gave in the year one thouſand four hundred eighty three, in favour of that Famous Houſe, wherein there are at this Day maintained three hundred poor blind People of both Sexes, according to the intention of their Founder St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> But it was not here that the Perfidy and the Cruelty of theſe Infidel Emirs ſtopped; for beſides that they would never reſtore either the Arms, the Horſes, the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the Baggage of the Chriſtians, they picked out all the handſomeſt young Men, and making them kneel down one after another, under a Scymiter which the Executioner held up ready to give the blow, they preſſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Jeſus Chriſt, and embrace the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And in truth ſome of them overcome by a Cowardly fear of Death, abandoned their Religion to preſerve a Criminal Life, which rendred them Infamous before God and Man, for their baſe Apoſtacy; but the greateſt number of them diſpiſing the Menaces of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> died gloriouſly in confeſſing Jeſus Chriſt, for whoſe ſake they had taken upon them the Croſs. And thus it was that the Succeſs of this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> which appeared ſo unfortunate in humane appearance, became moſt happy in the ſight of God, whoſe Glory was highly exalted by theſe new Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>The King was ſurprized with this News and the perfidiouſneſs of theſe <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> meaning well himſelf he thought during all the time of the Truce, which he had concluded for ten years, that nothing was to be feared as to <hi>Palestine;</hi> but now perceiving he was deceived, although he had cauſed the Ships to be made ready for his return into <hi>France,</hi> yet he called an Aſſembly of all the Princes and Lords both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Where having opened to them the condition of his Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> where it was apprehended that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his abſence; as alſo the terms in which they then ſtood with the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who openly infringed the Treaty of the Truce, and that in the moſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inſolent manner in the World, he commanded them to conſider ſeriouſly what they thought fit to adviſe him thereupon; and to give him their Opinions within eight Days, Whether he ought to return into <hi>France,</hi> or remain ſome time longer in the Eaſt. The eight Days being expired, the Council was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſembled, where there were two Opinions, directly oppoſite one to the other, propoſed. The firſt was that of the greateſt number of the <hi>French</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>That he ought with all convenient Expedition to return into</hi> France. <hi>Firſt, to give the neceſſary Orders for the Affairs of his Realm, which ſtood in great neceſſity of his preſence. Secondly, in regard that having but a very few Knights, and Souldiers, and who having nothing to ſubſiſt upon, nor being Maſter ſo much as of any one place in the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>he could not remain there either with ſafety, Honour, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf or the Affairs of the Chriſtians in the Eaſt. And that he might ſerve them much more effectually, if after having been ſometime in</hi> France <hi>to raiſe Money, and Levy new Troops, he ſhould have a deſire to return into</hi> Egypt, <hi>to take Vengeance upon theſe perfidious Enemies of God, who had ſo barbarouſly violated their Faith and Treaty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all the Knights of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> the Patriarch, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and all the Lords of <hi>Paleſtine, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and even divers of the <hi>French</hi> Lords among which was the High Steward of <hi>Champagne,</hi> the brave Lord <hi>Joinville,</hi> declared themſelves of the contrary opinion, and ſtrongly urged, <hi>That the Honour of the King, and welfare of all Chriſtendom in the East, obliged him to ſtay ſome time longer in the</hi> Holy Land; <hi>That it would be moſt ſhameful to abandon ſo many brave Men, as had ſo faithfully ſerved him in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and alſo to expoſe them to the fury of their Enemies, who would find them after his retreat much weaker than they were at his coming thither; That it was moſt certain that in the condition wherein things
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64918:202"/>were, the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>of</hi> Paleſtine <hi>would not ſtay there;
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1250</label> but ſo ſoon as they ſhould ſee the King depart, they would alſo abandon the Country, and retire to Places of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore his ſuddain Retreat muſt of neceſſity occaſion the loſs of all the Realm of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for the Conqueſt whereof the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>of</hi> Europe, <hi>and eſpecially thoſe of</hi> France <hi>had ſpent ſo much of their Blood, and undertaken ſo many</hi> Cruſades; <hi>and that ſo many thouſands of poor Captives, who ſighed in the Priſons of</hi> Caire, <hi>whereof many were the Relations, the Allies, or the Friends of thoſe who were in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the King's return, would be reduced to the utmoſt diſpair, having once loſt all hope of even a poſſibility of their deliverance; ſince the</hi> Infidels <hi>would have nothing either to hope or fear from the</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>after having once chaſed them out of</hi> Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine. And in concluſion, they added, <hi>That the ſtay of the King in the</hi> Holy Land <hi>for ſome time longer, would without doubt produce the quite contrary Effects to all theſe Misfortunes, which would infallibly be conſequent upon his return; That it was well known, that the King notwithſtanding all his loſſes ſuſtained in</hi> Egypt, <hi>was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repair one part of them, and to ſtrike a terror into his Enemies, in regard that all the Money which he had yet expended, he had drawn out of the Purſes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, who had gained it unjuſtly from him; That he had ſtill his whole Treaſure intire, with which he might raiſe ſtore of good Troops, and that ſo ſoon as it was known that he would pay well, he could not want Souldiers, but that men at Arms, and Knights would reſort to him from all places, with which he might ſerve himſelf, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, to very good purpoſe, there being in reality ſo great a Diviſion among the</hi> Infidels, <hi>that the Sultan of</hi> Alepo, <hi>the moſt potent of the</hi> Saraſins <hi>of</hi> Syria, <hi>made War againſt thoſe of</hi> Egypt; <hi>That he had already taken</hi> Damaſcus <hi>from them, And that he was reſolved in Perſon to lead his Army into</hi> Egypt <hi>to revenge the Death of the Sultan his Couſin, whom thoſe infamous</hi> Mamalukes <hi>had ſo barbarouſly murdered; That the leaſt advantage which the King could draw from this War, would be to oblige theſe perfidious Wretches by the fear which they would have leſt he ſhould joyn with their Enemy, to ſet all the Priſoners at liberty; That however hereby he would hinder the</hi> Infidels <hi>from invading the Lands of the</hi> Chriſtians; <hi>And that in the mean time he might fortifie the places, which were demoliſhed; and thereby leave the Country in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend it ſelf whenſoever at laſt he ſhould be obliged to return and leave the</hi> Holy Land.</p>
                  <p>After he had patiently heard all theſe Reaſons, the King took eight days more to conſider of what Reſolution he ought to make; after which having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain cauſed his Lords to be aſſembled, and imploring before them the Light and the Grace of God's Holy Spirit, he ſpoke to them in theſe Terms. <hi>That he gave all of them hearty thanks for the Counſel which they had on both parts given him; That if any worldly conſideration could oblige him to return into</hi> France, <hi>moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was the Intereſt of his Realm, to which he owed his Principal Applications, and his greateſt Care; But in regard that he was ſufficiently ſatisfied, that</hi> France <hi>had nothing to fear, ſo long as it was under the wiſe Government of the Queen, his Mother, who had Forces, Courage and Conduct enough to defend it againſt all thoſe, who ſhould in his abſence have any deſigns againſt it, he was reſolved not to abandon the Intereſts of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt in</hi> Syria; <hi>but that he would ſtay there ſome time longer to put them into a poſture of ſafety; That nevertheleſs he left all Perſons, who had a deſire to it, at liberty to return if they ſo pleaſed; but withal he promiſed alſo on the other ſide to all thoſe who were reſolved to run his Fortune, that he would make their choice ſo advantageous, that they ſhould have ſufficient reaſon to be ſatisfied with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe of the King moved the whole Aſſembly, though with very different Sentiments; in ſome it excited tenderneſs and Devotion, ſo that they devoted themſelves moſt heartily with this amiable Prince to the Service of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; in others it occaſioned Grief and Sadneſs, by underſtanding the King's Reſolution, which was ſo unexpected to them, and by ſeeing that their honour obliged them againſt their Inclinations ſtill to remain in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But hereupon St. <hi>Lewis</hi> did not fail preſently to give out Commiſſions, and Money for making of Levies; however for the ſatisfaction of the Queen, his Mother, he ſent home the two Princes, his Brothers, into <hi>France,</hi> whither he writ to all the orders of the Realm, that admirable Letter, by which, after he had given them a full account of all the tranſactions, which till then had happened, he
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64918:203"/>exhorted them by all the conſiderations both Divine and Humane,

                  <p>Whileſt theſe things were doing, the King, who made his preparations with ſo much diligence, received the Ambaſſadors, which came to him from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and from <hi>Aſia.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ſent to give him conſolation by his Legates for his misfortune; and writ to him moſt excellent Letters, dated from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> the twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by which, after he had ſaid all the fineſt and moſt Chriſtian things ſuitable to give conſolation to a Prince in Afflictions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he conjured him by no means to abandon <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but offered him all that he himſelf ſhould think the <hi>Holy See</hi> was able to aſſiſt him in.

But they fearing the Arms of the King offered to give him all manner of ſatisfaction, and to ſurrender to him all the Realm of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was in their hands, provided that he would aſſiſt them againſt the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who, they ſaid, offered the King what was none of his own. And to manifeſt at this time that they dealt ſincerely, they ſent immediately to him all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Priſoners, as alſo the Bones of Count <hi>Gantier de Brienne;</hi> and ſometime after the King peremptorily deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that as a preliminary, before he would enter upon a new Treaty with them, they ſent him the Heads of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they had ſet upon the Walls of <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> and all the Children and Young People, whom they had compelled to deny the Faith of Chriſt; which alone were conſiderable Effects of the reſolution, which this Prince had taken to ſtay in <hi>Syria.</hi> The <hi>Ancient</hi> of the Mountain alſo, who at firſt, according to his inſolent cuſtom, had ſent to demand a kind of Tribute, which the other Princes had been uſed to pay him, that thereby they might live in ſafety, ſent new Ambaſſadors to him, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of Rock-Cryſtal in diverſe Figures, which was the only Rarity of his Country, deſiring his Amity and Protection in a moſt ſubmiſſive manner. And the King in return alſo ſent him, with rich preſents, Father <hi>Breton,</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> who was very ſkilful in the <hi>Saraſin</hi> Language, to endeavour his converſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that pious deſign was not followed with anſwerable Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>But that which was moſt taken notice of by the <hi>French</hi> Lords, was the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage of the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> who believing the King was ſtill a Priſoner offered him all that lay in his Power for his deliverance; and aſſured him, that he had writ in moſt poſitive terms to the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of whoſe death he was then ignorant, to let him know, that he would renounce his Amity and his Alliance, if he did not immediately reſtore the King to Liberty, with all his People, who were Priſoners. In truth the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> Lords diſtruſted the Intention of this Emperor, in regard that although the King would never break with him, notwithſtanding his differences with the Pope, yet nevertheleſs, that Prince had alway manifeſted a diſpleaſure, becauſe St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had protected Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> by affording him a Sanctuary in <hi>France,</hi> and giving him the Liberty to hold a Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where matters were carried ſo high againſt him. However they rejoiced mightily, that theſe Ambaſſadours did not arrive till after the King had regained his liberty; in regard their was reaſon to be afraid leſt if they found him ſtill a Priſoner they might poſſibly have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured underhand to hinder his deliverance: But let it be as it will, this was one of the laſt Actions, good or bad, that <hi>Frederick</hi> did, for he died not long after in the ſame Year at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> the third of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Actions of his Life were diverſly diſcourſed of, ſo was alſo his Death; ſome will have it, That he died impenitent, without any fence of God or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without Sacraments; That he was poyſoned, and alſo ſtrangled by the hands of <hi>Mainfrey,</hi> one of his Natural Sons, whom he had made Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi> and who, by this <hi>Parricide,</hi> thought to ſeize upon his Treaſure, and the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And the Monk of <hi>Padua,</hi> makes no manner of difficulty to ſend him directly to Hell, loaden, as he clowniſhly enough expreſſeth it, with a Sack full of his ſins.

Here it was that the Admirals of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to anticipate their Enemy and ingage the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Party, ſent their Commiſſioners to aſſure him, that they were ready to ſurrender the Young <hi>Runnegado's,</hi> and the Heads of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they had ſet upon the Walls and Towers of <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> and that they would alſo acquit him of the two hundred thouſand Livres, which were yet unpaid, which the King reſolved before he would treat with them, in regard that they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Truce, by not obſerving the Conditions of their former Treaty, and thereupon, as the Admirals gave him all the Satisfaction, which he demanded, he appointed them a day to meet him at <hi>Jaffa,</hi> where a new Treaty was to be made, by which the Admirals obliged themſelves to put into his hands all the Places of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to which they ſhould for the Future make no more pretenſions; and the King reciprocally promiſed to aſſiſt them with all his Forces againſt the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> their Enemy.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Sultan, who was a man of Courage and Conduct, underſtood that the King had accorded with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he ſent twenty thouſand men to ſeize upon the Paſſes between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but this did not hinder the King from leading his Army to <hi>Jaffa,</hi> the Caſtle whereof was very ſtrong though the Town was wholly ruinous; and fell to rebuilding and fortifyng of it at great charges and with incredible diligence, although the Enemies gave continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Alarms to his Camp, and daily made a ſhew as if they would attack it. This made the <hi>Mamaluke</hi> Admirals, who had not yet ſet their Army on foot, and therefore durſt not repair to <hi>Jaffa,</hi> requeſt the King to deferr their Interview, and to appoint another day, when they might be in a condition to attend him; and in the mean time the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> having aſſembled all his beſt Troops, took a review of them about <hi>Gadres,</hi> which was anciently called <hi>Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> a ſtrong City on the other ſide the Sea of <hi>Galilee;</hi> and from thence paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Jordan</hi> he went and joined with thirty thouſand Horſe, which he had ſent before him to the Frontier of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into which he entred to revenge upon the Admirals the death of his Couſin. And they who had had leiſure to prepare for
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64918:204"/>his coming did not fail to give him a welcome like men of Courage,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1251</label> and who underſtood War. It came preſently to a Battle, and at firſt the Sultan had the advantage, breaking in upon one of their Wings ſo vigorouſly, that he put it into diſorder, and wholly routed it. But the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> underſtanding that their Army was Victorious in the other Wing, rallied, and came to the charge more furiouſly than before againſt their Vanquiſhers; and then thoſe alſo, who had been Victorious on the other ſide falling upon their Rere, cut them in pieces and made the Victory ſo complete, that all the Sultan could do was to ſave himſelf, and retreat to <hi>Gadres</hi> ſorely wounded, with two thouſand men which only eſcaped in that Bloody Battle.</p>
                  <p>After this great Victory, the Admirals made a ſuddain turn like able Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For now perceiving that they had no more need of the Arms of the King, they believed that to preſerve to themſelves the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which by Treaty they were obliged to ſurrender unto him, it was much better for them to make Peace with the Sultan, who ſeing himſelf abandoned by the King, would without doubt be very glad to revenge himſelf, and for fear of having both Armies upon his Hands,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1252</label> to accomodate matters with them. They ſent therefore to him to <hi>Gadres,</hi> offering him Peace, and at the ſame time deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it from him. They excuſed themſelves for the death of the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Couſin, by the neceſſity, which they had to prevent their own by giving him his; and remonſtrated to him, that it was for their Common Intereſts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to unite againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were their Common Enemies, than by their diviſions to give them the opportunity to make uſe of their Arms to the mutual deſtruction one of another. The Sultan, who deſired nothing ſo much, willingly harkned to the Propoſition, ſo that without any difficulty, a Peace was preſently concluded betwixt them; and the King by too long deferring to conclude with the one or the other of them, was miſerably deceived by them both, and loſt not only the nobleſt opportunity of recovering the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by an honourable Treaty, but on the ſuddain found he had two puiſſant Enemies, to encounter, who would now no more hear either of a Peace or a Truce, and who might eaſily have both been ruined, by keeping up the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between them, and uniting with the one againſt the other, as they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But though the King was a great Saint, we muſt not believe that Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips render men infallible, eſpecially in Policy, and above all not in matters of War, which is the remoteſt thing from Religion, whoſe Principles are thoſe of Love and Peace.</p>
                  <p>All the advantage, which the King gained by this Rencontre, was to quit himſelf of the two hundred thouſand Livres to the Admirals, which yet in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he was no ways obliged to pay, after they had ſo perfidiouſly broken their firſt Treaty. Sometime after they had made this Peace with the Sultan of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> although they ſaw they had nothing to fear, either from this Prince, their Allie, or from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were in too weak a condition to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them; yet conſidering that it was impoſſible for their Empire to ſubſiſt any conſiderable time without a Head, they reſolved at laſt to create one of their own Body to the excluſion of the <hi>Arabians, Egyptians,</hi> and all the Deſcendants of the Great <hi>Saladin</hi> and <hi>Saphadin.</hi> And being well aſſured that there were none able to oppoſe them, they accordingly choſe for their Sultan one of the <hi>Mamaluke</hi> Admirals, whom they named <hi>Azzadin Aibec,</hi> or <hi>Elmahec:</hi> For there is not one of theſe Sultans, but who have different names, in diverſe Authors, who have writ concerning them. This Sultan was a <hi>Turcoman</hi> by Nation, and from thence it is, that many Hiſtorians call him <hi>Turquemin.</hi> However from this time the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> held the Empire of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not by Succeſſion but Election, till the Year one thouſand five hundred and ſeventeen, when <hi>Selim</hi> the Emperor of the <hi>Turks</hi> conquered it, after he had in a great Battle overthrown and near <hi>Grand Caire</hi> taken <hi>Tomombey</hi> their laſt Sultan.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the Sultan of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> under the Favour of this Peace, having aſſembled his Army, came with thirty thouſand men to diſcharge his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Territories of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He preſented himſelf before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,</hi> and threatned to fire the Suburbs, if they would not redeem them from that danger, with fifty thouſand <hi>Byſances</hi> of Gold; but the Lord of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64918:204"/>of the Realm, thought fit to pay him in another Metal,
<label type="milestone">

And from thence therefore having underſtood, that the King, who had rebuilded <hi>Jaffa,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to repair <hi>Sidon</hi> or <hi>Sajetta,</hi> had but a few Troops with him, by reaſon that he had ſent the greateſt part of his Souldiers to ſeize upon <hi>Belinas,</hi> formerly called <hi>Ceſarea Philippi,</hi> he marched with a deſign to ſurprize him. The King, who was advertiſed thereof, was obliged to retire into the Caſtle and to quit the Town, which was not yet in a condition to be defended. The <hi>Saraſins</hi> therefore having ſurprized and cut in pieces two thouſand of the Servants and Peaſants, who followed the Camp, entred without reſiſtance into <hi>Sidon,</hi> which they once again demoliſhed, overthrowing the Walls to the very Foundation. But the Sultan being afraid that the other part of the Army, which had by force taken <hi>Belinas,</hi> ſhould march and take <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he marched away in all haſte to defend his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City. Whileſt the Troops which he feared, having not been able to take the Caſtle of <hi>Belinas,</hi> and being drawn from a dangerous Country by the Wiſe Conduct of <hi>Oliver de Termes,</hi> one of the moſt hardy and Valiant Knights of the Army marched back again by another way to join the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1253</label> It was at this place, that this great Saint did that admirable Action of Charity and Humility, which to this very day ſurprizes all mens minds with wonder, for that he might oblige both the Officers and Souldiers, to render with him the laſt duty to thoſe poor creatures, who had been ſlain by the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, whoſe Bodies lay half putrefied above ground near the City, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took the moſt infected of them upon his Royal ſhouldiers, carrying thoſe to their interment, whoſe offenſive ſmell was ſcarcely to be endured, without ſhewing any manner of averſion for his loathſome burden, as did thoſe of his retinue, and without receiving the leaſt inconvenience from theſe infected Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. A rare example even among the greateſt Saints, but much more among the greateſt Princes, and which may well make the delicacy of thoſe bluſh, who being ſo much below ſuch elevated Majeſty have ſuch an extreme averſion for the Exerciſes of Chriſtian Piety, when they are never ſo little contrary to the Inclinations of Nature; ſo that they are only contented to ſerve God when they can ſo accomodate his ſervice with their own, as that they may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing any thing of either their profit or their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>After this, the King, according to the deſires of the Lords of the Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repair the ruins of <hi>Sidon,</hi> which he made ſtronger than ever it had been before. He did the ſame to the City and Caſtle of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> which was very neceſſary for covering the City of <hi>Acre,</hi> whoſe Walls and Towers alſo he took care to repair, and to fortifie the Suburbs in ſuch a manner as to put them in ſafety againſt the attempts of the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> This did ſo much ſurprize them with wonder, that they were not able ſufficiently to admire the Power, the Riches, and the Magnificence of this great King, who after he had, as they thought, by his extreme misfortune loſt all in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had ſtill ſo much treaſure as to defray thoſe prodigious expences, which it is well known are ſo neceſſary for the maintaining of Armies, building of Cities, and erecting of Fortreſſes. In ſhort, during the time that he remained in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he fully ſatisfied his devotion to God as well as his Duty to the Intereſt of the Country, for he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Holy Mountain of <hi>Tabor,</hi> and the Sacred Chamber of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where, accompanied with the Legate and all the Lords, he celebrated the Feaſt of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation with the magnificence of a King, thereby to honour God more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently among the <hi>Infidels</hi> with the Piety of a Saint, and to inflame the devotion of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Country, who generally were not addicted too much to it, or to lead their Lives conformable to the Holineſs of thoſe ſacred places, which they did inhabit. Above all, he had an extreme deſire to viſit the Holy City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe Walls the <hi>Saraſins</hi> had rebuilded, and who would willingly have given him the liberty to enter into it as a Pilgrim. But his Council did not think it convenient, that one of the greateſt Kings of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ought to go thither to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt before his Holy Sepulchre, before he had conquered it from the <hi>Infidels;</hi> for otherwiſe they ſaid, the other Princes, who after him ſhould undertake the Voyage to the Holy Land, would believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

This ſo amazed the Pope, <hi>Innocent,</hi> who after he had ſtruck him with the <hi>Anathema,</hi> had no other Arms, to which he might have recourſe to oppoſe him, that he believed he was obliged, to cauſe a <hi>Cruſade</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt him; which without doubt did not contribute much to the Succeſs of that which proved ſo unfortunate againſt the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> And at the ſame time he cauſed the two Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> to be offered, firſt to <hi>Charles d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> who would not then accept them without the conſent of the King, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was then in <hi>Syria;</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Richard,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry,</hi> the King of <hi>England;</hi> but he alſo refuſed them, not thinking it was at all agreeable to Juſtice or a good Conſcience, to deſpoil the young Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> his Nephew, to whom the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> had left, for his ſhare, the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Whileſt matters ſtood thus, <hi>Conrade,</hi> who had underhand procured the Death of this little Prince, his Brother, that he might have his Kingdom, died himſelf of Poiſon, which as it was believed was given him by his Brother <hi>Mainfrey,</hi> to whom, as not ſuſpecting him Guilty of his Death, <hi>Conrade</hi> left the Tuition of his Son <hi>Conradin,</hi> then an Infant of the Age of three Years.</p>

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> aſtoniſhed with this Progreſs, and fearing that he ſhould at laſt fall under the Power of ſuch a formidable Enemy, had recourſe to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and following the Example of <hi>Innocent,</hi> he offered him the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for his Son <hi>Edmund,</hi> to whom he alſo ſent the Inveſtiture of them: and to oblige that King to undertake the enterpriſe, he abſolved him from the Vow, which he had made in taking the Croſs, to be of the <hi>Cruſade</hi> againſt the <hi>Saraſins</hi> in the Eaſt, by changing it into that which he cauſed to be Preached every where againſt <hi>Mainfrey.</hi> Alſo fearing leſt the Partiſans of the Houſe of <hi>Suabia</hi> ſhould place <hi>Conradin</hi> upon the Imperial Throne, in the room of Count <hi>William,</hi> who had been ſlain in the War againſt the <hi>Frieſlanders,</hi> he ſent Prohibitions to all the Electors, requiring them under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not to chuſe that young Prince.

But at laſt, having well examined the matter, he kindly aſſented to the King's deſire, and highly approved of his Pious Deſign; and conſequently reſolved not to loſe ſo fair an opportunity to form a Holy League againſt <hi>Bendocdar,</hi> to which, in the beginning of his Pontificate, he had exhorted not only all the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Abagas,</hi> the King of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in <hi>Perſia.</hi> For this purpoſe therefore he ſent <hi>Simon de Brie,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecily,</hi> his Legate, into <hi>France,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>Othobon</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with order to paſs from thence, as he alſo did, into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> then he ordained, as he had done formerly, that the Religious of the orders of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſhould Preach the <hi>Cruſade</hi> through all <hi>Germany,</hi> as far as <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi> But nothing of all this had any Succeſs, except only in <hi>France,</hi> by the diligence, the Care, the Example, and admirable Zeal of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> For ſo ſoon as the Legate was arrived, this devout King called a general Aſſembly of the Princes, Prelates, and Barons of his Realm, to his Royal Palace in <hi>Paris,</hi> where with all his Power and Eloquence, animated with his Ardent Zeal, he himſelf exhorted the whole Aſſembly <hi>To take upon them again the Croſs, to avenge the Injuries which the</hi> Saraſins <hi>had for ſo long time done to Jeſus Chriſt, in the faireſt part of his Empire, and to maintain the Chriſtians in their proper Inheritance, out of which the Sultan of</hi> Egypt <hi>and his</hi> Mamalukes, <hi>the particular Enemies of the Name and Nation of</hi> France, <hi>were upon the point of driving them, unleſs they were ſpeedily aſſiſted.</hi> He proteſted, <hi>That he was reſolved, even tho he were abandoned by all the reſt of the World in ſuch a Noble Enterpriſe, to purſue it vigorouſly himſelf, and to imploy all that he had, his Forces, his Fortunes, and his Life in this Glorious Service; and that he ſhould infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rejoyce to loſe it in his Service, who had laid down his precious Life for the Love which he had to Mankind, in that precious ſpot of Earth, for the Recovery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he exhorted all the</hi> French, <hi>who he doubted not had doubtleſs the ſame Courage with which their Anceſtors had ſo gloriouſly conquered it, to take up their Arms and accompany him in this Noble Enterpriſe.</hi>

                  <p>A Diſcourſe of this Nature ſpoken with unexpreſſible Graces, and by ſo great a King, whoſe Age, Experience, Wiſdom, Equity, and Love, which he had for his People, and above all his Eminent Sanctity, rendred ſo much beloved and revered by his Subjects, did ſo ſenſibly affect the Hearts of all the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that after the Legate had made his Speech upon the ſame Subject, and the King himſelf had with a Marvellous Devotion received the Croſs, the greateſt part of the Princes and Lords, following his Example, alſo took it upon them.

                  <p>Theſe were followed by all the other Knights and Lords of the Aſſembly, except only the Lord <hi>Joinville,</hi> High Steward of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who having had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the firſt Voyage, diſpenſed with himſelf for the ſecond, alledging that by the firſt he had ruined his poor Subjects of the Lordſhip of <hi>Joinville;</hi> and in the ill humour in which he was by reaſon of this ſecond Undertaking, which he did not at all approve, he hath written very plainly, That it was the opinion of many Learned Men, that thoſe who gave the King this Advice <hi>ſinned mortally,</hi> in regard that the King was ſo weak in Body, and brought ſo low, that he was but juſt in a condition to maintain that Peace and juſtice, which by his preſence he cauſed to flouriſh in his Kingdom, and which would by his abſence be moſt certainly baniſhed from thence. But this was not the opinion of <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth, who was eſteemed one of the moſt learned and pious Popes, which the Church had ever had, and who, St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> having conſulted him concerning this Voyage, extremely approved of it, as did alſo the Confeſſor of this Holy King. And this makes it evident, That in all times the moſt ſevere Caſuiſts have not always been the moſt knowing, nor the ſafeſt adviſers in difficult matters.</p>
                  <p>After this great Action, St. <hi>Lewis</hi> applied himſelf with an indefatigable Zeal, to diſpoſe all things for the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> ſparing neither diligence, pains, nor coſt to put it into a condition to have better Succeſs than he had met with in his firſt Voyage, and to draw along with him not only the <hi>French,</hi> his own Subjects, but alſo ſuch of other Nations, as were willing to ſhare with him in the Enterpriſe. And for this purpoſe he did what was poſſible in conjunction with the Pope to make an Accord between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> that ſo they might enter with him into this <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> But it was all Labour in vain, for theſe two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, whoſe difference occaſioned ſo many miſchiefs to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> had too much animoſity one againſt the other, to unite ſo eaſily or ſo quickly. As for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had at firſt treated with him for his paſſage, they at laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed themſelves from furniſhing him with Shipping, by the fear which they ſaid they had, that the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> reſenting it, ſhould ſeize upon all their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects within his Ports. But the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> who always ran counter to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and who upon this occaſion acted more nobly, offered him theirs. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his Royal Liberality obliged <hi>Edward,</hi> Prince of <hi>England,</hi> to take up the Croſs, a Prince whom he highly valued for his Spirit and his Valour, and gave him thirty thouſand Marks in Silver, to put him into an Equipage to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him like a great Prince; offering the ſame Sum to <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who had ſome years before taken upon him the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>The Pope alſo on his ſide did not fail to excite the Kings and Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, by the Example of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> to joyn their Arms with thoſe of this great King for the deliverance of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the oppreſſion of the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who wanted not above two or three Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be Maſter of all that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>Syria, Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſince the time that they were conquered by <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen;</hi> but all was in vain. <hi>Ottocare</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Saxony, Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Otho,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and divers others, whom <hi>Clement</hi> excited to take the Croſs, and ſome of which had already taken it, were ſo incumbred by the Schiſm of the Empire, and beſides ſo exaſperated by the Death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> which for a long time rendred the Name of the <hi>French</hi> odious to them, that they could not be perſwaded to entertain a thought of uniting with them in the <hi>Holy War.</hi> The King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who diſputed the Empire, and whoſe Brother had been taken with <hi>Conradin,</hi> was in the ſame opinion.

                     <hi>James,</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> made the faireſt advances in the World towards this War: He proteſted in the Aſſembly of the Princes at <hi>Toledo,</hi> That he would accompliſh his Vow, although his Age ſeemed to diſpenſe with him for it, and notwithſtanding all that could be done to divert him from it. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Valentia</hi> to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and to thoſe of <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that he would go in Perſon into <hi>Paleſtine</hi> againſt the Sultan <hi>Bendocdar.</hi> He alſo cauſed a fair Fleet of Men of War to be fitted out at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and a great many Gallies, and imbarked himſelf in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> one thouſand two hundred ſixty nine, a year before St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> But being near the Iſles of <hi>Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorca</hi> met with a furious Tempeſt, which threw him upon the Coaſts of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he went no farther than <hi>Aigues-Mort,</hi> from whence he returned by Land into his own Kingdom; alledging, for the hiding of a certain ſhameful and criminal Paſſion, which governed his Soul, and which poſſibly was the true cauſe of his altering his reſolution, That he was well ſatisfied, that God diſpenſed with him for his Voyage, which he made known by this accident was not at all pleaſing to him; ſo that there were only ſome few Ships of this Fleet which arrived at <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> with <hi>Dom Ferdinand Sancho,</hi> the Son of this King, who preſently after returned again without doing any thing.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerned the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, he acted in this occaſion only like a Politician, for his own private Intereſt, without ever intending to have any ſhare in this War. This Emperor was <hi>Michael Paleologus,</hi> who, about eight years before, had taken <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by Treachery from the <hi>Latins,</hi> who loſt that Empire under <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Second, which <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Firſt had ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conquered with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> about fifty eight years before. This <hi>Greek</hi> Prince, who feared to be attack'd on the ſide of <hi>Aſia</hi> by <hi>Bendocdar,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Sultan ſhould have conquered <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and who was already on the Coaſt of <hi>Greece</hi> by the New King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> did all that poſſibly he could with the Pope and the Princes of the Weſt, to ingage them in a War againſt the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> And in regard that the Pope had written to him, That the way to ſecure himſelf from the Arms of the <hi>Latin</hi> Princes, was to unite the <hi>Greek</hi> Church with the <hi>Latin,</hi> and to go in Perſon as did St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to this <hi>Holy War,</hi> he promiſed Shipping, Proviſions, and Souldiers, and all that could be deſired for the War. He alſo ſent his Ambaſſadors into <hi>France,</hi> offering to make the King the Arbiter of the difference which was about the Re-union of the two Churches, but St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who would not undertake to be Judge in a matter of this nature which was purely ſpiritual, remitted him to the Judgment of the Sacred College, the <hi>Holy See</hi> being then vacant by the Death of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> who deceaſed about the end of the preceding year. But after all, this Emperor, who was extreme politick, had no deſire or deſign, either to make a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, or to joyn with the <hi>Latin</hi> Princes in the <hi>Holy War.</hi> All his Deſign was only to engage them in a <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and thereby to deliver himſelf from the fear which he had of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> So remote are the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Princes, who act purely according to the Maxims of human Policy, from what they ſeem to appear to thoſe with whom they negotiate, with a deſign to delude them.</p>
                  <p>And for the King of <hi>England,</hi> to whom the Pope had at firſt ſent the Cardinal <hi>Othobon,</hi> his Legate, he was too far advanced in years, and too much oppreſſed with his own Affairs, by reaſon of the troubles of his Realm, to be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perform the Vow, which he had made, in taking upon him the Croſs, and to acquit himſelf of the Promiſe by which he was ingaged to the King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in this War with five hundred Knights, for whom the King gave him a years pay in hand; and believed that without reſtoring the Money, he ſatisfied fully for all, in giving his Bleſſing to his Son, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a condition to enter upon Action till after the Death of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do almoſt nothing in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Thus of above two hundred and fifty thouſand men, which were levied in <hi>Europe,</hi> there were none but the Troops of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> which were about ſixty thouſand men, and the few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which went with the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> his Son-in-Law, which were in a condition to purſue this Voyage. Nevertheleſs, he undertook it with ſo much reſolution,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:64918:209"/>as if he had had the Forces of the whole Earth.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1269</label> The difficulty was only to reſolve whither he ſhould go, and after having a long time conferred upon this Affair with the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he reſolved at laſt to go firſt againſt <hi>Tunis,</hi> before he undertook to attack the Sultan of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was for this purpoſe repreſented to the King, that he ought to begin with the Realm of <hi>Tunis,</hi> if he would go immediately, as in reaſon one ought to do, to the Spring and the Root of the Miſchief; in regard that it was from <hi>Tunis</hi> that the Sultans of <hi>Egypt</hi> drew their principal Forces; their Horſes, and the beſt of their men: And beſides that in leaving this Kingdom in their Reer, as they muſt do if they marched directly againſt <hi>Egypt,</hi> or into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> they muſt expoſe themſelves to the hazard of loſing their Convoys and the Supplies which were to come from <hi>Europe,</hi> which would run the Fortune of being defeated and taken by the Shipping of theſe <hi>African</hi> Pirates, who were continually cruſing upon the Seas: There were alſo many other Politick Conſiderations added, which are eaſie to be found out, when People are reſolved to maintain an Opinion. But in Truth that which was moſt prevalent, was, that the Inclinations of the two Kings were both conformable to this Enterpriſe, for two very different Reaſons. For <hi>Lewis,</hi> who, like a great Saint regulated all his Actions by the Principles of Piety and Chriſtianity, believed that in ſhewing himſelf before <hi>Tunis,</hi> that <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King, who had given him hopes of his Converſion, would turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and be baptized, which the King moſt paſſionately deſired, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by what he ſaid to the Ambaſſadors of that Prince, whom he commanded to acquaint their Maſter, <hi>That he would be contented with all his heart to be a Slave to the</hi> Saraſins <hi>again, and to paſs the reſt of his Life in the moſt dreadful of their Dungeons, and never more to ſee the Sun, provided that the King of</hi> Tunis <hi>would with his whole Realm embrace the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>Charles,</hi> who was more Politick than Devout, reſolved to make uſe of ſuch a fair opportunity, to aſſure himſelf of that Realm, which without doubt was very convenient for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Coaſts of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> Thus the two Brothers reſolved each upon the ſame thing, though both of them for private Reaſons, which they did not impart to any Perſons, but only concluded upon the Enterpriſe againſt <hi>Tunis;</hi> the King, who fore-ſaw that it would not meet with a general appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, reſerved the Declaration of his Reſolution till he came to <hi>Cagliari</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> at which place he had appointed the Rendezvous of his Navy.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1270</label> All things being thus diſpoſed for ſo great an Enterpriſe, the King declared <hi>Matthew de Vendoſme,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and <hi>Simon de Clermont,</hi> Count <hi>de Neele,</hi> Regents of the Realm during his Abſence; and after that having taken the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> according to the cuſtom of his Anceſtors, as alſo the Scarf and the Pilgrim's Staff, he parted the firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſeventy, accompanied with the Cardinal <hi>d' Albano,</hi> whom Pope <hi>Clement</hi> had nominated his Legate for this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and came to <hi>Aigues-Mort,</hi> where he did not imbark till the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> at the ſame time that the other part of his Fleet ſailed from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and at laſt all of them, after having been ſoundly beaten by a furious Tempeſt, arrived at <hi>Cagliari.</hi> There it was that the King held a great Council of War, to which all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Lords, and principal Officers of the Army were called.

                  <p>Upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> over againſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> there is a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> whoſe circumference is about three hundred and forty <hi>Stadia,</hi> or two and forty miles, which advanceth it ſelf into the Sea between two Gulphs, which it there makes.

It had eight Gates with their Portculliſſes, a very deep Ditch, which environed it on the Land ſide, and all manner of Fortifications, which were uſed in thoſe Times, with large Suburbs which contained about ten thouſand Houſes. But it was ſtill become much greater, ſince the greateſt part of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> who had been driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> retired thither, and applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all manner of Arts and Trades. It is at preſent a kind of Republick under the Protection and Domination of the Grand Seignior, ever ſince it was taken by <hi>Sinan Baſſa</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred ſeventy four; It had before been twice taken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> once by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in the year one thouſand five hundred thirty five, and a ſecond time by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> But formerly it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular Kings, ſince a certain Perſon, one <hi>Abraham Aben Ferez,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there for the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> uſurped this Realm from him about ſixty years before this <hi>Cruſade,</hi> and it was his third Succeſſor <hi>Muley Otmen Oſtenſa,</hi> who reigned at <hi>Tunis,</hi> then when St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom he had made to hope his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, undertook this Voyage.</p>
                  <p>At firſt this Holy King had reaſon to believe that this Prince had an Intention to accompliſh his Promiſe, by reaſon that there was not found any who oppoſed his landing, and that he had opportunity to ſeize the Port of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and after that the Tower, almoſt without any reſiſtance. But he was quickly diſabuſed, by ſeeing a great Army ſally out of <hi>Tunis,</hi> to relieve the Caſtle of <hi>Carthage;</hi> but that did not hinder, but that it was taken by the Seamen only with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of five hundred Croſs-bows, which they deſired of the King, aſſuring him that they would carry the place by <hi>Scalade,</hi> which they accordingly did with ſo much Courage and Succeſs, that they made themſelves Maſters of it in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, without any other loſs than only one of their Companions, whoſe Death they revenged by that of all the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who defended the place, who were partly cut in pieces, and partly ſmothered in the Vaults, whither they retreated to ſave themſelves, and to the Entries of which the Seamen put fire. The King, who was advanced and drawn up in <hi>Battalia</hi> between the Caſtle and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to hinder their relieving the place, ſtopped them ſo well by the brave Countenance which he made, that the <hi>Saraſins</hi> durſt never quit their Poſt; they retired at Night towards <hi>Tunis,</hi> and ſatisfied themſelves with returning every day in greater numbers, giving continual alarms, and pickeering on all ſides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their manner, without ſtaying in one place, either regularly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack one Quarter, or to march in <hi>Battalia</hi> and combat foot to foot with their Enemy.</p>
                  <p>This was what was done in this laſt Enterpriſe of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in nine or ten days, towards the end of <hi>July.</hi> For in regard the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> had an Army compoſed of an infinite multitude of <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> who had always a ſafe retreat under the Walls of <hi>Tunis,</hi> which was extraordinarily provided with all ſorts of Machins of War, it was not thought convenient by his Council to attack them, or to undertake the Siege of the City before the arrival of the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was daily expected. In the mean time the King retrenched himſelf, and fortified his Camp in a Vally below <hi>Carthage,</hi> whither the Enemies came continually to Skirmiſhes, in which they conſtantly had the worſe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever coming to a General Battle.</p>

For it being high Summer, which is a ſeaſon very improper, for making of War in <hi>Africa,</hi> and that they wanted refreſhments, and above all freſh Water, which is very ſcarce in that Country; Diſeaſes, and eſpecially the Flux and Fevers, fell into the Army, and in a ſhort time made a moſt fearful deſtruction. The greateſt part of the braveſt and youngeſt men of the Army were unable to reſiſt the violence of this terrible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which daily carried off abundance of them. And among the reſt, <hi>John Triſtan,</hi> Count de <hi>Nevers,</hi> a Young Prince of about twenty years of Age, died upon the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the King, his Father, who loved him moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, although it was a moſt ſenſible Affiction to him, yet ſacrificed it to the Will of Heaven, with the reſignation and conſtancy of a <hi>Chriſtian Hero.</hi> The Cardinal Legate did not ſurvive the Young Prince above four or five days; and <hi>Philip,</hi> the eldeſt Son of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> was alſo ſeized with a quartan Ague, of which, by the Strength of his Age, and the heat of the ſeaſon, he was quickly delivered. But the King, his Father, who had already fallen into the Flux, being ſhortly after ſeized with a continual Fever, left the whole Army lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing with extreme Grief for his death, which happened the five and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after he had received the Sacrament with an admirable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, an incomparable Piety and Sedateneſs of Spirit, having nothing in his heart or upon his lips, but the Glory of God, for which only he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Voyage. He was conſtantly ſaying with a dying, but Intelligible Voice, to thoſe who applyed their Ear to his Mouth to receive his laſt words. <hi>For the Love of God let us indeavour ſome way to have our Holy Faith preached and received at</hi> Tunis. <hi>Ah! My God, whom ſhall we find to ſend thither to declare thy Goſpel? It muſt be ſuch a one,</hi> would be ſay, naming a certain Religious of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who was known to the King of <hi>Tunis;</hi> and with theſe Zealous Ejaculations, and this Apoſtolick fervency, which he had for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſalvation of <hi>Tunis,</hi> he rendred his pious Soul into the hands of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, preciſely at the ſame hour, that Jeſus Chriſt gave up his to his Father, making the ſame wiſhes for the Salvation of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>I have believed that in the quality of an Hiſtorian of the <hi>Cruſades,</hi> I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, in giving an account of the death of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> to recount this admirable circumſtance, which is ſo eſſential to my Subject, ſince it ſhews ſo well what was the end, which he propoſed to himſelf in forming this Enterpriſe of <hi>Tunis.</hi> and for the other particularities, which in ſuch a wonderful manner appeared in his death, and all that which is ſo precious before God in the death of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Saints, as they do not properly began to my <hi>Cruſades,</hi> I leave them as well as the other admirable and Holy Actions of his miraculous life to thoſe able Writers, who ſo many years ago have promiſed us, and who as I hope will write it exactly after ſo many Originals and ſo many Copies, as the Writers of his own and the following times have left us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add, to give ſome <hi>Idea</hi> of his Body, and of his Mind, that he was then about the Age of five and fifty years, of a middle Stature, and a delicate Complexion, but which he had greatly weakned by his great Auſterities. His Viſage was ſomething long, but full, his Forehead large and Majeſtick, his head a little inclining to one ſide, his Eyes extreme ſweet, his Mouth little and pleaſing, his Speech eaſie and very agreable, and in his whole Perſon, an Air of Goodneſs ſo winning, and ſo charming, eſpecially in a King, that it was impoſſible to look upon him without loving him, or to love him without paying him that reſpect which was due to the Majeſty of ſo great a Prince. And for the Qualities of his Soul, whether Natural or acquired, one may ſay, That there are few Princes, who have poſſeſſed them in thoſe high Degrees of Perfection as he did; for he had an admirable compoſure of Spirit, quick, and clear, and which he had cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Study of polite Learning, and a ſolid Judgement; ſo that he was always the moſt able Perſon of his Council, always penetrating further than any of them, when any difficult matter was under conſideration, having very eaſie conceptions of things, and expreſſing himſelf <hi>extempore,</hi> with much Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:64918:211"/>and Ingenuity,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1270</label> whatever he had to deliver; governing much by himſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after his return from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> but yet never acting but with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Council, except in the Treaty, which he made with the Engliſh, to whom, to oblige them to quit the reſt, he ſurrendred <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> not out of any ſcruple, as <hi>Nangis</hi> writes, ſince he himſelf acknowldged in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> could not pretend any Right to them; but for Peace ſake: although herein his Policy was much miſtaken, by reaſon that this Treaty having brought a Stranger into <hi>France,</hi> brought a War upon it, which laſted above two hundred years, before he could again be expelled out of it. This indeed is the only blemiſh, with which St. <hi>Lewis</hi> can be reproached for having in this occaſion, contrary to the advice of his Council, ſuffered himſelf to be too far miſled by the Goodneſs of his Nature. For as for any thing elſe, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found in his Life but an admirable compoſure of all Royal and Chriſtian Vertues, in a moſt exact Temperament. For he was the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, courageous, fearleſs, firm and immoveable in the midſt of the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and withal the moſt ſweet, pacifick, kind, and moſt eaſie of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Auſtere, humble, modeſt, devout, reſpectful to the Holy See, zealous for the Glory of God and the Salvation of Souls; retired, patient, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, above all that is admired in the moſt Apoſtolick Men, and the moſt Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among Recluſes for their penitent Life: and yet nowithſtanding at the ſame time he was obliging, affable, complaiſant, and of an agreable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in his Converſation, familiar with his Confidents, eaſie in his Domeſtick Affairs, an admirable Husband, an indulgent Father, a ſure Friend, a good Maſter and a moſt excellent King, loving his Subjects, and reciprocally beloved by them; firm and inexorable in cauſing Juſtice to be done, his Ordinances, and Laws to be obſerved; Jealous of the Rights of his Crown, and thoſe of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, conformable to the Common Law, againſt all the abuſes, all the Novelties and the indeavours of ſuch as would ſhock them; he was liberal and magnificent in the ordinary expences of his Houſhold, in Ceremonies and publick entertainments, which upon certain occaſions he made very much to the Honour of <hi>France,</hi> with a Splendor and Majeſtick Pomp, far ſurpaſſing all his Predeceſſors, which made him be equally admired both by the <hi>French</hi> and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. In ſhort there was never ſeen a more perfect accord, than what appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this admirable Monarch of Royal Majeſty, mingled with true Sanctity of Chriſtianity, without Illuſion, without Weakneſs, and without Defaults. And I cannot tell whether one can find another, of whom may be ſaid with ſo much Juſtice, what I have ſaid of this Chriſtian <hi>Hero;</hi> to finiſh in one word his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and his Elogy, <hi>That he Was the greateſt King of a Saint, and the greateſt Saint of a King, that ever any age hath known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army of <hi>France</hi> was under an extreme conſternation for the death of the Holy King, and for the Indiſpoſition of <hi>Philip</hi> his Succeſſor; and their was great probability, that they ſhould in that very moment abandon this unlucky Enterpriſe if the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was in a great meaſure, by his long delay, the Cauſe of this ill Succeſs, had not by a ſtrange adventure arrived with a fair Fleet at the very ſame time that his Brother, the King, breathed out his laſt. As he was a great Captain, and that his Army, which was compoſed of <hi>Neapolitans, Sicilians,</hi> and <hi>Provencals,</hi> was very freſh, and he, having ſtill in his head his firſt deſign to aſſure himſelf of the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> in at leaſt making the <hi>Saraſin</hi> King become his Tributary; he eaſily perſuaded the <hi>French,</hi> that it was for their Honour to finiſh the War, which they had begun with ſo much Courage, and which they might bring to a happy period being ſtrengthened by the Conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of ſuch a Potent Army as deſired nothing ſo much as to be led to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat againſt the <hi>Saraſins.</hi> Hereupon the Army advanced towards <hi>Tunis</hi> to block it up more cloſely, and for three Months there were every day ſome little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the <hi>Moors,</hi> who always went off with diſadvantage; And it is alſo reported, that they were once overthrown in a ſet Battle, that their Camp was taken and plundered, and that ſuch of them as fled, thinking to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the City, blindly precipitated themſelves into thoſe trenches, which they had digged in the Fields, with a deſign to have the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fall into them: but in regard thoſe of our <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> who writ in thoſe times, ſay nothing of any
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:64918:211"/>ſuch matters I dare not be confident of the truth of them.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1268</label> That which is very certain, is, That the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> ſeeing, that the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> daily gained upon him, and that he was always beaten, fearing that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſhould loſe his Kingdom, he ſent to deſire a Peace, or at leaſt a Truce, offering to ſubmit to ſuch conditions, as the two Kings themſelves ſhould judge to be fair and reaſonable. This matter was long debated in the Council of War, in which many were of opinion, that the Siege ought to be vigorouſly preſſed on, without hearkning at all to the Propoſition of the <hi>Saraſin</hi> King, who, they ſaid, after the loſſes, which he had ſuſtained, was in no Condition for any long time to defend the City. But the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> remonſtrated to them, That if they ſhould take the Town, of which they were not to be too confident, yet it was impoſſible for them to keep it, in regard, That though the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might be commodiouſly quartered there, it being now very near Winter, they could not receive either from <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Sicily</hi> ſo much proviſion as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of the Troops; and that if they left there only a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, it would not be able to defend it againſt all the Forces of <hi>Africa,</hi> which would moſt certainly attack it: And therefore he concluded, that the way for them to come off with Honor, and ſafety in this Affair, was rather to treat with the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> in an honourable and advantageous manner, and like Conquerors, rather to give him Law, than to put themſelves into the manifeſt danger of loſing all. Thus, in regard that King <hi>Philip</hi> was alſo very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go, as ſoon as he could, to take poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, a Truce of ten years was concluded with this Inſidel Prince upon theſe following Conditions. <hi>That he ſhould preſently pay a round ſum of Money, upon which they were agreed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Charges of the War; That he ſhould deliver all the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Slaves, which were in his whole Realm; That he ſhould permit the Religious of the Orders of St.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick <hi>and St.</hi> Francis <hi>to preach the Goſpel, and to build Monaſteries there, and to all his Subjects Liberty to receive Baptiſm; And that he ſhould yearly pay to King</hi> Charles <hi>a Tribute of forty thouſand Crowns,</hi> which was the ſum that the King paid to the Pope for the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> See what were the aims of <hi>Charles</hi> for his private Intereſt; and what it was, which made many honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple murmur againſt him, as beleiving that he had no mind to take <hi>Tunis,</hi> becauſe he could not hope to diſpoſe of it as he pleaſed, and that he had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed this War but for his own Ends, to make this <hi>Saraſin</hi> King his Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> alſo, who arrived before <hi>Tunis</hi> with his Fleet, at the ſame time that this Treaty was concluded, could not hinder himſelf from making the extreme diſpleaſure, which he had at it, appear publickly, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſaw that the Fleets of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> without thinking any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their principal deſign, which was the <hi>Holy War,</hi> were upon the point of returning home. And indeed ſo ſoon as the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to quit himſelf of theſe People, who had put him into the fear of loſing his Capital City and his Kingdom, had delivered the Captives, and paid the Money which was agreed upon by the Treaty, the two Kings imbarked; <hi>Philip</hi> with the Bones of his Father, which, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe times, were ſeparated from the Fleſh; and <hi>Charles</hi> with the Fleſh and Entrals of that Holy King, which he cauſed afterwards to be magnificently interred in the Church of the Abby of <hi>Montreal</hi> near <hi>Palermo.</hi> And certainly it was very advantageous to theſe two Kings, that they carried with them, in their Ships, the Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of that Saint, which preſerved them from that Lamentable Wreck, which the greateſt part of the others ſuffered in View of the Port of <hi>Trepano</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> eighteen of the biggeſt men of War, and a great number of ſmaller Veſſels, with all the Money which was received of the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and above four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men were caſt away in this Tempeſt; and it was not without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that the Kings were able to make the Port of <hi>Trepano,</hi> where <hi>Thibald,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> who was ſick before, when he came from <hi>Tunis,</hi> in a few days after his landing, died; Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Wife, the Daughter of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> did not ſurvive him long, for about four Months after ſhe died at <hi>Yeres</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</hi> And for King <hi>Philip</hi> having taken his way by Land as far as <hi>Meſſina,</hi> he paſſed over into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo croſſing quite through it and <hi>France,</hi> he came to

And therefore as ſoon as he was recovered of a dangerous Wound, which he had received from an Aſſaſſin, whom he truſted, and whom he himſelf killed with the ſame poiſoned Dagger, with which the Traitor had ſtruck him, he returned opportunely to take poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Henry,</hi> his Father, dying left unto him.</p>

                  <p>The Subject of this Quarrel is one of the points of Hiſtory, which Writers have made the leaſt clear, and which in fews words I will endeavour to explain. <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Amauri,</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Heireſs of that Realm, had four Husbands.

                  <p>For immediately after the death of <hi>Conradin, Hugh</hi> the third, the King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> who was deſcended in a right Line, from <hi>Alice de Champagne,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> by her third Husband, paſſed into <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> and at <hi>Tyre,</hi> cauſed himſelf to be crowned King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in right of his Grandfather. But the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> maintained, that the Realm appertained to her, in regard that being the Daughter of <hi>Meliſantha,</hi> ſhe was nearer by one degree to Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> than <hi>Hugh,</hi> who was the Son of her Couſin. The Proceſs hereupon laſted a long time. The Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> oppoſed the Coronation of <hi>Hugh;</hi> but perceiving that the Patriarch took little notice of her oppoſition, ſhe appealed to the Holy ſee, and came in perſon to purſue her right before Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth, who appointed Delegates for the Examination of the matter. She alſo preſented her ſelf to the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Juſtice. And the cauſe being remitted to the Barons of the Realm, who neither eſteemed, nor much loved King <hi>Hugh,</hi> the Princeſs at length with the conſent of Pope <hi>John</hi> the twenty firſt, judicially transferred to <hi>Charles d' Anjou,</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> all her Right and Title upon certain condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by a Treaty,

For it is more eaſy to take what may be had of what is our own, than to recover what belongs to us, and might be had, though not without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, charge and hazard.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Charles,</hi> who reſolved to take poſſeſſion of his new Realm, ſent <hi>Roger,</hi> Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Severin,</hi> to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where he was received by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who put the Fortreſs into his hands.

                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the joy which his Death occaſioned among the Chriſtians, but it was much increaſed by the taking of the Fortreſs of <hi>Margath,</hi> and by the Defeat of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who indeavoured to retake it from the Knights of the <hi>Temple;</hi> but above all by the great Victory of the <hi>Tartars:</hi> for theſe People being entred into <hi>Syria,</hi> laid all waſt before them, without giving any Quarter to the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> when at length <hi>Melech-Sais,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Bendocdar,</hi> Marched out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with an Army of two hundred thouſand Men to give them Battle.

And indeed a very conſiderable aſſiſtance, which the Pope ſent at his own charges, into the Eaſt, upon twenty <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies, arriving not till after the concluſion of this Truce, was conſtrained to return without doing any thing.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1290</label> For this purpoſe, as he had always a powerful Army on Foot, he entred ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> in the year following, and advanced towards <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia;</hi> and then when he was upon the point of going to inveſt <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> the <hi>Emir,</hi> whom he had made his Lieutenant, thinking by the favour of the Souldiers to obtain his place, gave him Poiſon whereof he died.

                     <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> of whoſe Situation and Strength, I have given an account in the fifth Book of this Hiſtory, was at this time one of the faireſt, richeſt, and moſt flouriſhing Cities of all the Eaſt, by reaſon of the great Commerce of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, which were brought thither from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> by Land and Sea, to be from thence tranſported into <hi>Europe.</hi> And as it was become the Capital City of the Realm, ſince the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Sanctuary, where all the Chriſtians of <hi>Palestine</hi> took Refuge, after the loſs of their Cities, ſo it was alſo then more Populous than ever it had been; and ſuch great Induſtry had been uſed in theſe late times, in fortifying it, that it was thought to be impregnable; above all having at leaſt thirty thouſand Men well Armed to defend it, beſides eighteen thouſand <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who were arrived there a little before, without a Commander. But this unfortunate City had within its Walls, two kinds of Enemies infinitely more formidable than all the Forces of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and which were the cauſe of its being loſt.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1291</label> The firſt was the diviſion which occaſioned moſt fearful Diſorders, in regard that beſides that there were two Factions, which held one of them for the King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> and the other for the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> the <hi>Piſans,</hi> the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Templers,</hi> the <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Knights, the Princes of the Country, and even the Patriarch, and the Legate of the Pope, would every one ſo divide the Government, as to be independent upon all others; ſo that it might be ſaid, that there were in <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> ſo many different Cities, as there were quarters poſſeſſed by theſe Orders, and different People, who were not only without a Head, whoſe Supreme Authority and Orders they ſhould all obey, but who were for the moſt part in Arms one againſt another. And that which was yet more deplorable, and which doubtleſs was the principal cauſe of the Deſolation of this unfortunate City, was, that the Corruption of manners was ſo great, and the irregularities of Peoples Lives, or rather the inundation of all manner of Crimes, and even of the moſt Infamous and Scandalous Vices, were ſo exceſſive and horrible, that the Divine Juſtice was even neceſſitated to exterminate ſuch an abominable Race of Men, who calling themſelves Chriſtians by their Actions, ſo Wicked and Impious, Blaſphemed that and his Sacred Name among the Infidels. So that one may ſay, as one of the Authors of that time does, who was a long time in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and averrs it for a deplorable Truth, <hi>That of all the People which inhabited</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>the Christians were the moſt notoriouſly lewd and wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sultan, who had ſuch a numerous Army, and compoſed of expert Souldiers, and above all his <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> who were extreme brave, attacked the City upon the Land ſide by main Force, battering the Walls and the Towers Night and Day, making abundance of Mines every where, and ſapping the Foundations of the Towers, particularly thoſe of the Tower called <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> or the Curſed Tower, which was as it were the Fortreſs of the City. The beſiged alſo at firſt defended themſelves vigorouſly, being in continual hopes of relief by the way of the Sea, which they had open, and being united for their better defence under one Chief, whom by common conſent they choſe among all the Captains, which was <hi>William Beaujeu,</hi> Great Maſter of the <hi>Temple,</hi> a moſt Valiant Man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly skilful in Martial Affairs. But there arrived to their aſſiſtance only five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, and two hundred Horſe, who were conducted by the King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> And the Great Maſter of the <hi>Temple</hi> being unfortunately ſlain with a poiſoned Arrow, they loſt their Courage, and finding themſelves without a Commander, they fell into all their former Quarrels and Diſorders; inſomuch that the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who had already made themſelves Maſters of two or three Towers, giving a General Aſſault, upon the eighteenth Day of <hi>May,</hi> carried the City firſt by the Gate of the Curſed Tower, and after by all the other paſſages, which thoſe of the City baſely abandoned preſently after, to ſave themſelves upon the Ships.</p>
                  <p>But nevertheleſs there were but a very few that eſcaped, who threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt into the Ships; and who with the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the principal among the Knights and the Officers of the Nations, arrived at laſt in the Iſle, after having been in great danger of periſhing by a dreadful Storm, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them in their paſſage; for by a ſurcharge of Misfortune, the Sea ran ſo high that Day, that the greateſt part of thoſe, who, to avoid the Swords of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſins,</hi> threw themſelves into the Water, thinking to gain the Ships, were Drowned. The Patriarch himſelf, who had already boarded a Gally, upon which he was juſt going to imbark, deſiring out of his Charity to take into his Skiff, as many as he could of theſe miſerable People, which were in Shoals got into the Water to come to the Ships, was ſunk to the bottom, by the too great Number with which the Boat was loaden, and at leaſt at his Death did the Office of the good Shepherd, who gives his Life for his Sheep, although he could not thereby ſave theirs, by dying for them in this manner. All the reſt were expoſed to the fury of theſe Barbarous Victors, who filled all with Death and Slaughter, making Slaves of all thoſe whom the Sword ſpared, after they had, by all manner of Diſorders and Violence, glutted their inſatiable Cruelty and Luſt.</p>
                  <p>There were there always a certain Number of Virgins, conſecrated to God, who nevertheleſs found out a Marvellous way to preſerve their Virginity
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64918:214"/>inviolated, even by the aſſiſtance of theſe Enemies of their Honor,

For the Abbeſs of the Nunnery, which was of the Order of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> ſeeing that the City was taken, and that they could not eſcape the hands of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> whoſe Cruelty was leſs terrible than their brutiſh Luſt, ſhe exhorted her Daughters with a moſt Heroick Courage, and an admirable ſervor of Spirit, to imitate her example, if they would preſerve that treaſure, which ought to be a thouſand times dearer to them than their Lives. And thereupon ſhe cut of her own Noſe, making her ſelf horribly deformed in the Eyes of Men, to be admirably beautiful in the ſight of God, whom only ſhe deſired to pleaſe. All the others doubtleſs animated by a like inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, which had formerly inſpired a Holy Abbeſs in <hi>England,</hi> in the ſame manner, did preſently the ſame Execution upon themſelves, by their Blood to extinguiſh the brutiſh Flames of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who finding them in this condition, which gave them a horror, they inſtantly Murdered them all, and by this obliging Cruelty, gave them the means to add the Palm of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to that of their Virginity, and as the Scripture expreſſeth it, to waſh their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb; to have the Honor to follow him. The <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who were their ſpiritual Fathers, and had a fair Convent in <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> were alſo all Slain without Pity, and above ſixty thouſand periſhed in this fatal loſs of the City, or were carried Captives into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Day, which was the nineteenth of the Month, the <hi>Templers,</hi> who yet held the principal Tower of the <hi>Temple,</hi> after having cut in pieces three hundred <hi>Saraſins,</hi> who were entred into their quarter, and who during a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, had attempted the Honor of the Ladies, had a deſtiny like that of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> For they were all overwhelm'd with the fall of their Tower, which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown with the Sape, and which Buried with them under the ſame Ruines, the Enemies which did Attack them. Thus the Famous <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which had been taken a hundred years before, by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Auguſt,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Richard Coeur-de-Lyon,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> after having maintained a Siege of three years, againſt more than three hundred thouſand <hi>Cruſades,</hi> who came thither ſucceſſively, was retaken by the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in four and forty Days, and with it the Chriſtians loſt all their Courage and their Judgment to that degree, as to ſuffer all that remained to them in <hi>Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> to follow the ſame, or rather a more ſhameful Fortune, than that of <hi>Ptolemais.</hi> For thoſe who might very well have defended <hi>Tyre,</hi> a City which was extremely ſtrong, forſook it, and fled away upon their Ships, ſo ſoon as they heard the ſad news of the loſs of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> ſo that the next Day the <hi>Saraſins</hi> entred it, without reſiſtance. The <hi>Templers</hi> which were in <hi>Sidon,</hi> and in the Pilgrims Caſtle, did the ſame, upon ſeeing one of the Lieutenants of <hi>Melech-Seraph,</hi> prepare to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege them by Sea. And thoſe of <hi>Baruth,</hi> truſting to this perfidious <hi>Emir,</hi> who had promiſed to treat them as Friends, if in his paſſage through their Lands, they would repair to him, were all either cut in pieces, or ſent in Chains, to ſuffer a miſerable Captivity in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus theſe four Maritime places, being all that remained to the Chriſtians in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> were alſo loſt, and it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at this time, that they were wholly chaſed from thence, a hundred ninety and two years after that <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> and the other Princes of the <hi>Cruſade,</hi> had ſo gloriouſly Conquered and founded this Realm, which continued for near two hundred years, under fifteen or ſixteen Kings. And this makes it appear that it cannot be abſolutely ſaid that the <hi>Cruſades</hi> were unfortunate, no more than that by the ſame reaſon it can be maintained that the enterpriſes of the great <hi>Cyrus</hi> were not proſperous, becauſe the Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which he found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Conqueſts, did not laſt more than two hundred years, under thirteen Kings. But ſuch is the fatality of all Earthly things, which after their Birth and Eſtabliſhment, increaſe and continue till a certain Period, which Nature, or rather Divine Providence hath prefixed to them, as the term of their perfection, after which they decreaſe either inſenſibly, as in natural productions, or elſe ſuddainly by ſome great Revolution of Fortune, by which they ceaſe to be, what they had never been, but upon that neceſſary condition of fatality, that one Day they are to be no more. As for the reſt, the Victorious Sultan that he might take

                  <p>This ſad news of ſo great and unexpected a loſs, did wonderfully ſurprize Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fourth, who for above a year laſt paſt had uſed all imaginable induſtry to form a general <hi>Cruſade</hi> of all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Weſt againſt the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> who continually threatned <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> He had with powerful Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, invited all the Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> into it, and had prevailed ſo well, that <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had declared himſelf chief thereof, and had made great preparations throughout his whole Kingdom, to put himſelf into a Condition to march at the time, which this good Pope had named, which was at the Feaſt of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> in the year one thouſand two hundred and ninety three. When in the mean time, he underſtood, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had loſt all in <hi>Syria,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> one thouſand two hundred ninety one. This was like a mighty clap of thunder, which did mightily amaze him, but which nevertheleſs did not hinder him from redoubling his endeavours by his Letters, by his Legates, and by his Preachers, whom he diſpatched to all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to excite the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to take upon them the Croſs, and to unite the Princes of the Eaſt and Weſt, and even the Kings of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Iberians, Georgians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> with their forces in the deſign to recover together from their Common Enemy, what had been loſt for want of this Union. But the Evil being now believed to be deſperate and without Remedy, all that this Pope did, and all that his Succeſſors endeavoured to do afterwards upon this Subject, was never able to produce one <hi>Cruſade,</hi> to procure the recovery of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>

                  <p>He alſo made his preparations with extreme application and exceſſive coſt, ſurpaſſing all that any of the Kings his Predeceſſors had done upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; cauſing to be rigged in ſeveral Ports, the faireſt Fleet that ever <hi>France</hi> had ſeen, which was able to tranſport forty thouſand men at Arms with their Horſes, and which was furniſhed with all ſorts of Proviſions in prodigious abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. He had alſo taken great care, to publiſh this <hi>Cruſade</hi> throughout <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and had engaged the Kings of <hi>Arragon, Majorca, Sicily, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> to joyn their Arms with his, that they might all march together under his Conduct againſt the Sultan. So that it was thought this mighty Army of <hi>Cruſades,</hi> would conſiſt in three hundred thouſand Combatants, which already made the whole Eaſt to tremble, and filled the whole Earth with the Glory of the name of <hi>France</hi> and the noiſe of ſuch formidable preparations.</p>
                  <p>But as there is nothing more required to the fixing a mighty Engine and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it immoveable, but to ſtop the ſecret Springs, which give it that violent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which draws upon it the Eyes and admiration of the Spectators, by its prodigious movement; ſo the War which in the midſt of theſe tranſactions, <hi>Edward,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> declared againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> having ſtopped this Prince by obliging him to turn his Arms another way, and to defend himſelf, all this great <hi>Cruſade,</hi> about which he had taken ſuch care and pains, became vain and fruitleſs.
